Identifier          | 1371909803
Description         | An electrical trap that zaps nearby players
Crafting Recipe     | 3 HQM, 1 Tech Trash
Recycles Into       | 2 HQM, 50% 1Tech Trash
Stack Size          | 3
Workbench Required  | Level 2
Research Table Cost | 20 Scrap
Hit Points          | 250
Where To Buy        | Outpost for 75 Scrap
Where To Find       | Arctic Scientist, Cargo Ship Scientist, Crate, Elite Tier Crate, Excavator Scientist, Heavy Scientist, Locked Crate, Military Base Scientist, Military Crate, Oil Rig Scientist, Patrol Scientist, Treasure Box, Underwater Lab Blue Crate, Underwater Lab Elite Crate, Underwater Lab Yellow Crate
Inputs/Outputs      | Power In
Active Usage        | 35
Power Consumption   | 1-35rW
Despawn Time        | 5 minutes

Notes:

- Tesla Coil damage is the amount of input power per second up to a max
  of 35. This means if you give a tesla coil 5rW, it will do 5 damage
  per second. Give it 35rW and it will do 35 damage a second.
- Their damage is stackable. 100 Tesla Coils given 1rW will kill a
  person in 1 second.
- The range is just over 1 foundation or 3.5 meters
- Can be placed on all surfaces including the ground
- With a building trick, a tesla coil can zap people through walls,
  floors and roofs.
- They damage themselves at a rate of 2hp/sec
- They will not turn on if their health is at or below 62
