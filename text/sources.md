Identifier          | -1819763926
Description         | Generating electricity from the wind
Crafting Recipe     | 500 Wood/10 HQM/3 Gears/3 Sheet Metal
Recycles Into       | 250 Wood/5 HQM/2 Gears/2 Sheet Metal
Stack Size          | 1
Workbench Required  | Level 2
Research Table Cost | 125 Scrap
Hit Points          | 250
Where To Buy        | Bandit Camp for 500 Scrap
Where To Find       | Arctic Scientist, Cargo Ship Scientist, Elite Tier Crate, Excavator Scientist, Heavy Scientist, Locked Crate, Military Base Scientist, Military Crate, Oil Rig Scientist, Patrol Scientist, Treasure Box, Underwater Lab Elite Crate, Underwater Lab Yellow Crate
Outputs             | Power Out
Power Consumption   | 0rW
Power Output        | 0-150rW
Active Usage        | 0
Despawn Time        | 40 minutes
Decay Time          | 8 hours

Notes:

- Wind Turbines operate in both day and night
- The amount of power they output is heavily influenced by the number of
  floors above the ground they are, not sea level
- They will produce more power, more often the more floors above ground
  you place them
- Requires a 1x1 to be placed on and cannot be picked up with a hammer
- There is a small area at the base of the turbine, on some sheet metal
  where you can place components.
- A turbine made on an iceberg, will calculate its output based on the
  height of the buildable ground of the iceberg below the turbine, down
  to the ocean bottom. This means no additional height above an iceberg
  will increase its height calculation.

# Large Solar Panel![](images/image22.png)

| | |

Identifier          | 2090395347
Description         | Generating electricity from the Sun
Crafting Recipe     | 5 HQM/1 Tech Trash
Recycles Into       | 3 HQM/50% - 1 Tech Trash
Stack Size          | 3
Workbench Required  | Level 1
Research Table Cost | 75 Scrap
Hit Points          | 100
Where To Buy        | Outpost for 75 Scrap
Where To Find       | Arctic Scientist, Cargo Ship Scientist, Crate, Excavator Scientist, Military Base Scientist, Oil Rig Scientist, Patrol Scientist, Sunken Chest, Tunnel Dweller, Underwater Dweller, Underwater Lab Blue Crate
Outputs             | Power Out
Power Consumption   | 0rW
Power Output        | 0-20rW
Active Usage        | 0
Despawn Time        | 20 minutes
Decay Time          | 8 hours

Notes:

- Large Solar Panels output electricity only during the day.
- They will produce less power if they are damaged or the Sun is not
  making it to the entire front face.
- They can be placed on the ground or flat building structure.
- They can be picked up with a hammer but will lose 25% health.
- 24 hours in game is 1 irl hour

Depending on the time of year, the Sun will take a different path
through the sky. In June and July, the Sun reaches its most Northern
path. In December and January, the Sun reaches its most Southern path.
The picture above on the right shows how the Sun will traverse the sky
over 6 Rust months. A day in the game is an hour of real time. This
means it takes about 15 days for a full Rust Year. Wipe day is always
May 20th 2024 so depending how long or short your wipe is, and where on
the map you build, will determine the direction of your Solar Panels. If
you are only playing the first 3 days of a fresh wipe and you build in
the South, face the panels North and call it a day, but, if you are
playing a monthly wipe, placing them facing East and West is the
simplest option.

# Small Generator![](images/image76.png)

| | |  
|-|---|  
Identifier          | 1849887541
Description         | Generating electricity from Low Grade Fuel
Crafting Recipe     | 5 HQM/2 Gears
Recycles Into       | 3 HQM/1 Gears
Stack Size          | 1
Workbench Required  | Level 2
Research Table Cost | 75 Scrap
Hit Points          | 100
Where To Buy        | Outpost for 125 Scrap
Where To Find       | Arctic Scientist, Cargo Ship Scientist, Crate, Elite Tier Crate, Excavator Scientist, Heavy Scientist, Locked Crate, Military Base Scientist, Military Crate, Oil Rig Scientist, Patrol Scientist, Treasure Box, Underwater Lab Blue Crate, Underwater Lab Elite Crate, Underwater Lab Yellow Crate
Inputs/Outputs      | Force Start, Force Stop / Power Out
Power Consumption   | 0rW
Fuel Consumption    | 500 Low Grade Fuel/2hr
Power Output        | 40rW
Active Usage        | 0
Despawn Time        | 20 minutes
Decay Time          |

Notes:

- Small Generators will output electricity when they are turned on
- You can Start and Stop them manually or use one of the electrical
  inputs.
- The last input to receive power is the function that is activated,
  even if power is still being applied to the opposite.
- They must be placed on floors, foundations or the ground
- They still produce max power when damaged
- They can be picked up with a hammer but lose 20% health
- If a battery is feeding power to either of the inputs, components
  connected to Power Out will register an active usage on the battery.
