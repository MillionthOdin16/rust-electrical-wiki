# The RUST Electrical Handbook

---

This is a work in progress, everything is subject to change,
be reorganised or moved to some other sub pages,
but any info still valid in game wont be removed.

All the infos you can find here are comming from a [Google Doc file by @SwiftCoyote
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing),  
so thanks to him and all the people that contributed to it !

if you want to contribute to this project, there is multiple way you can do it:  

- you can report if you found a bug or have a suggestion,  
- you can maybe contribute code that fix or add it,  
- but the principal thing is informations,  
  where it is some new sections you want to add,  
  or some already there that you want to modify,  
  some reorganisation idea ...  

its made in a way so someone could edit the website content without needing to know html/css/javascript,
all the content is writen in markdown format (similar to discord messages: \**italic*\*, \*\***bold**\*\*, etc...)
for now i havnt written something that explains how to do it but you can ask me on discord
