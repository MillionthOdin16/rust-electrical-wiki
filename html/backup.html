<p>There are 2 types of battery backup systems. There is the Inline and
there are bypass backups like the OR/Blocker and the Nih Core.<br />
When deciding which backup to choose, there are a few factors you may
want to consider.</p>
<p>There are 3 main types of distribution systems which we call a Power
Bus. These are the Fixed, Dynamic and Configure.</p>

<p><img src="images/image86.png" /></p>
<p>This is when you directly connect what generates power to your
circuits. If your power source is destroyed or stops producing power for
any reason, your circuits will go offline. This method is a great
solution for short term uses like getting some auto turrets asap for
your clan or getting some water pumps online early for a berry farm.
While this method is good for a short time to get an early game
advantage, it is not recommended to rely on this method for any length
of time. We can introduce batteries to our circuits to create backup
power more suited for long term use.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to wire</li>
<li>Minimal components</li>
<li>Early game advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If power source is destroyed the components turn off</li>
<li>No backup power</li>
<li>Short term use only</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 main types of battery backups. Below we have the Inline,
OR/Blocker and Nih Core.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="inline"><a href="#inline" class="anchor-link">*</a>Inline</h2>
<p><img src="images/image26.png" /></p>
<p>This is called Inline because power must pass through the battery
before powering something. Inline is the easiest way to give yourself a
battery backup. This method is fast to make and wire. It is reliable
assuming you are producing enough power to keep the batteries charged
and it is an easy way to decentralize your circuits. When you connect
your power source directly to your battery, 100% of that power is used
for the sole purpose of charging your battery. When your battery is
fully charged, any power above what is needed to maintain your battery’s
charge is not being used, which we call wasted. For example, a large
battery with an Active Usage of 100, needs to be given 125 to prevent it
from draining. If you are giving your battery 150 so it charges, when it
is fully charged, there is 25 power that is not being used. When it
needs to be charged, that 25 power is better then 1 power because it
will charge faster. For 1 battery it doesn’t seem like a lot, but when
you get into 4 or more batteries, that is 100 power being wasted. When
the power source stops making enough electricity, the battery will
continue to supply power until they are depleted or destroyed. It is
recommended to let the battery charge to a minimum of 3000rWm before
letting it power anything.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to make with minimal electrical components</li>
<li>Perfect for decentralizing circuits</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient use of power at large scale</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="orblocker"><a href="#orblocker"
class="anchor-link">*</a>OR/Blocker</h2>
<p><img src="images/ORblocker.png" /></p>
<p>This method has been around for a long time and is often called
‘Infinite Power’. It is not infinite power, it is just a bypass battery
backup. It has been carried over from a previous version of electricity
when batteries could only charge or discharge, not both at the same
time. During this time batteries did not have an Active Usage and forced
out max power causing the need to invent the ‘Infinite Power Loop’,
which actually was something, but it was not this circuit.</p>
<p>This is an OR/Blocker battery backup. It is a ‘Bypass Battery Backup’
that powers your main circuit most of the time from the main power
source, bypassing the battery, while the excess power is used to charge
the battery. When not enough power is produced, it will automatically
switch on the battery keeping everything powered. The reason it is now
considered out of date is because it doesn’t take advantage of the
batteries ability to charge and discharge at the same time.</p>
<p>The way this method works is by sending power into the first
Electrical Branch and branching out enough power to meet your circuit’s
needs. That power is passed to an OR Switch which sends power to your
circuit. The extra electricity from the first Electrical Branch is sent
to another Electrical Branch. Power is branched out to block the Blocker
which prevents the battery from draining. The extra power is then used
to charge the battery. When there is not enough power to keep the
battery blocked, the battery sends power out to the OR Switch to keep
your circuits online. Based on the picture below, green wire showing
what has power, red showing no power and yellow showing wasted power.
<img src="images/orblockerstates.png" /> If the Windmill only produces
75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first
Electrical Branch or block the battery. The battery takes over powering
your circuit but the 75 power is still coming out of the first
Electrical Branch. The power is still there, it is just not being used,
it is wasted.</p>
<p>While considered out of date today for use as a primary battery
backup system, with some small modifications, it is useful as a
secondary battery backup which we talk about in its own section.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand</li>
<li>Simple to build</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using battery power</li>
<li>Ignores the battery update to allow charging and discharging at the
same time</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="secondary-battery-backup"><a href="#secondary-battery-backup"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Secondary Battery Backup</h2>
<p>A secondary battery backup is a way to provide power to a circuit
after the main backup system goes offline. It’s a backup of a backup so
the chance that it gets used on a typical day is near 0. Using the
picture below, we will break down how it works.</p>
<p><img src="images/image109.png" /> </p>
<p>We are using a Test Generator to represent a static power source
meaning power levels won’t go up or down like wind and solar. The power
will either be there or it will not so we install the battery pre
charged. It should never be used so we don’t plan on recharging it. The
static amount of power from your main circuit, which already has a
built-in battery backup already, makes this battery a secondary backup.
So because the incoming power does not fluctuate, it is either present
or it is not, when the power is no longer present, this battery takes
over. The only reason this battery is ever used is because the main
power sources are no longer supplying enough power and the main battery
backup has also failed. The chance this battery is needed should be 0 so
we dont bother building in recharging.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses only a few components so it’s easy to build and wire</li>
<li>Efficient for redundant backup power</li>
<li>Can be inserted into almost any circuit at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using a dynamic power source</li>
<li>Requires a pre charged battery</li>
<li>Added costs for redundancy  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="nih-core"><a href="#nih-core" class="anchor-link">*</a>Nih
Core</h2>
<p><img src="images/image87.png" /></p>
<p>The Nih Core is the modern version of and replacement for the
OR/Blocker. When using a battery to power your main circuit, like the
Inline battery backup, you lose 20% of the power it receives. Bypass
battery backups, like the Nih Core, are a way around this. Instead of
your main circuit being powered by the battery, it gets power directly
from the Wind Turbine while the battery gets charged with the excess.
The Nih Core will automatically switch over to battery backup when the
power source is not producing enough.</p>
<p>The Nih Core is meant to be used with 2 or more batteries but we only
have 1 in the picture because it’s all we need to demonstrate how it
functions. The simple explanation is when there is not enough power to
meet your circuit’s requirements, it redirects the insufficient amount
of power to the battery and activates it to take over powering the
circuit. The reason the Nih Core is meant for 2 or more batteries is
because when running off windmill power, we don’t care about the
battery’s Active Usage. We are bypassing the battery therefore removing
any restrictions or conditions caused by it. Check out the section
called ‘Battery Active Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed’ for an in depth
explanation.</p>
<p>Using the following picture, we can see where power exists and where
it doesn’t when the Nih Core is running off of Main Power vs Battery
Power. The green wires have power and the red wires do not.</p>
<p><img src="images/nih-core-paths.png" /></p>
<p>To understand how this works, we need to understand the Memory Cell
and the Splitter. The inputs on the side of the Memory Cell are
prioritized from top to bottom and the Splitter when it receives power,
it sends out power from left to right. This also applies to when
Splitters lose power, they stop sending power out from left to right.
The section ‘Circuit Delay and Power Flow’ helps explain in detail how
rustricity moves around a circuit.</p>
<p>Based on the picture above, if the windmill only produces 75 power,
it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first Electrical Branch
which is set to 100. That first Electrical Branch will still send that
75 power to the Memory Cell, but this means no power is going to the
second Electrical Branch therefore the Splitter loses power. When the
Splitter loses power, Output 1 first stops sending power to SET on the
Memory Cell. At that moment, power from Output 2 is still going to
RESET, so the Memory Cell flips outputs. RESET loses power followed by
Output 3 going to Block Passthrough on the Blocker. The battery takes
over powering your circuit and the 75 power that is still going through
the first Electrical Branch and Memory Cell is now sent to the battery
extending its life instead of being wasted. This will take a 4 hour
backup time and extend it.</p>
<p>Here is a look at a Nih Core with 4 batteries. Keep in mind Max Depth
when using large numbers of power sources and</p>
<p><img src="images/ctr-nih-core.png" /></p>
<p>batteries. 16 power sources and 16 batteries is the most you can
connect before hitting the Max Depth. Check out the section ‘Short
Circuit / Max Depth’ for an in depth explanation on that subject.</p>
<p>If you notice that power is flickering off/on when switching between
main power and battery power, it is because 1 of 2</p>
<p><img src="images/nih-core-flicker-fix.png" /></p>
<p>issues. If using only 1 battery, Solution 1, add a Root Combiner
between the battery and blocker to keep the battery active. If using
more than 1 battery,  Solution 2, add 1 or 2 components between the
Memory Cells <code>Power Out</code> and the OR Switch. This will give
the circuit a chance to provide battery power before the Memory Cell
flips outputs.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-power-bus"><a href="#what-is-a-power-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>What is a Power Bus?</h2>
<p><img src="images/image127.png" /></p>
<p>A power bus is a group of components with the sole purpose of
directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that perform
specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot like the
breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your electricity.
Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or purpose, like
the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. A power bus also helps
prioritize the order in which circuits receive power. In the event you
are producing less power then you need, you have built in control over
which circuit is last to go offline. We have 3 types of power buses,
fixed, dynamic and configurable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fixed-bus-f-bus"><a href="#fixed-bus-f-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Fixed Bus (F-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image115.png" /></p>
<p>A fixed bus, known as an F-Bus, is when you dedicate a specific
amount of power per output. This type of power bus always consumes the
amount of power each output is set to even if nothing is attached to
Branch Out. This will affect Inline battery backups by forcing an Active
Usage and it will affect a bypass battery backup by always consuming
power, even when the components connected to Branch Out are offline. A
fixed bus is an easy way to build in priorities and a bit of security.
The first Electrical Branch has the highest priority because it’s the
first to get power and in the event that power levels start falling, it
will be the last branch to lose power. The security comes from knowing
that if 50% of the power supply disappears, only some branches will lose
power and not all.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dynamic-bus-d-bus"><a href="#dynamic-bus-d-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image51.png" /></p>
<p>A dynamic bus, known as a D-Bus, is when we let the components evenly
distribute power between all connected outputs. The only control you
have over the amount of power available to each output is the amount of
power you put into it. This is primarily used when the component or
circuit attached to each output requires the same amount of power or
when each circuit uses less than the available power and you want to
avoid the forced Active Usage from an Electrical Branch. If an output
gets destroyed, the system will evenly redistribute power between the
remaining outputs. The drawback would be that if the incoming power
drops too low to support the connected outputs, everything will stop
working or at least those that require the full amount of power that was
previously present.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="configure-siphon-c-bus"><a href="#configure-siphon-c-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Configure Siphon (C-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/multi-c-bus.png" /></p>
<p>A configure siphon, known as a C-Bus, is a bypass distributor that is
only active when required. The idea here is that we only want to use
power when the C-Bus is active otherwise the power just passes through.
We can set an Electrical Branch in the siphon to a specific amount of
power to only be used when the siphon is active. There are multiple
versions of the C-Bus, and we will dive into each one, but to start, I
just want to explain the concept.</p>
<p>All of them are centered around the Memory Cell. The Memory Cell has
2 outputs, Output and Inverted Output. One output is called the Main
Line (aka the bypass) and the other output goes to the Circuit that we
want to power. The Main Line is the default path the electricity takes
when the siphon is not active. It will pass from a Memory Cell to an OR
Switch and out. The Circuit path is the route electricity will take when
the Memory Cell gets triggered. It gets sent to an Electrical Branch
that is configured to an amount of power the circuit needs while the
remainder gets sent off to the OR Switch and back onto the Main Line to
continue powering the circuits past it. While this is the general
concept, we can get a little more specific.</p>
<p>There are 2 categories of Configure Siphons. There is the Auto Reset
which will automatically turn itself on when an input is received and
off when the input signal is removed. The second is Manual which
requires you to manually turn it on and off. Within each of these
categories there are 2 types. There is the standard C-Bus which is to be
used in a circuit that uses a bypass battery backup like the Nih Core.
The second type is the Blocked C-Bus meant to be used in a circuit that
uses an Inline battery backup. The reason 1 has a Blocker is because of
the nature of components and a battery’s Active Usage. The Blocker has
the ability to hide Active Usage from a battery when it is actively
being blocked. Read more about that in the section titled Battery Active
Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed.</p>
<p>Now to get very specific. Starting with the Auto Reset siphons, these
by default will send power out the Inverted Output(left output). Power
will be passed to an OR Switch then out. In the Blocked version, power
gets passed to an Electrical Branch that is used to block a Blocker
before passing power to the OR Switch and out. ‘Out’ could be another
siphon, another type of power bus or whatever you would like. We are
using a HBHF Sensor as our input source but it doesnt have to be. All we
need is a constant source of power to keep the siphon active. When the
sensor outputs power, it will ‘SET’ the Memory Cell. This will force the
Memory Cell to flip outputs and send power through Output(right output).
From Output, power will be sent to an Electrical Branch configured to +2
over the amount of power your circuit will need. The leftover power will
pass through Power Out and merge back into the Main Line. The power
coming out of Branch Out will go to another Electrical Branch that will
be set to the amount of power the circuit actually needs. The reason for
+2 is because we need 1 for the second Electrical Branch itself and 1 to
be sent out Power Out to ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell. In the blocked
version, we are simply adding a Blocker before the first Electrical
Branch so we can hide the Active Usage caused by the Electrical Branches
from a battery. When the sensor stops sending power to ‘SET’, the power
going to ‘RESET’ will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs back to
Inverted Output and return power to the Main Line. In the blocked
version, because of the Electrical Branch on the Main Line, the Blocker
will get blocked again to hide the Active Usage.</p>
<p>The Manual siphons function in a very similar way only instead of
using ‘SET’ or ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell, we are using ‘TOGGLE’.
Everytime ‘TOGGLE’ receives power, the Memory Cell will flip outputs. We
have used the Button in the pictured examples but it doesnt have to be.
When it comes to which output on the Memory Cell is the Main Line or the
Circuit line, it really doesnt matter because you have the ability to
manually control which output power is actively passing through.</p>
<p>In all the examples we have used Counters at each output. This is
only to show you how much power each C-Bus costs to not be active. <a
