# Radio Frequency (RF)

---

Radio Frequency or RF for short, is a signal that can be sent or
received anywhere on the map.  

Small Oil Rig: 4765 / Large Oil Rig: 4768 / Giant Excavator: 4777

Transmitters cannot be set to frequencies between 4960 and 4990

Receivers can be set to frequencies between 4960 and 4990

- When it receives a signal, it will output power and continue to do so
  until it stops receiving a signal.

&nbsp;

- They can be placed on most flat surfaces including Workbenches and the
  top of TC
- While not passing power through, it will block any components active
  usage effectively hiding them from batteries.
