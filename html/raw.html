<p>Description: Used to pick up or repair components</p>
<p>Crafting Recipe: 100 Wood</p>
<p>Despawn Time: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For electrical, this is used to pick up and repair components</li>
<li>Can be stored in a Tool Cupboard</li>
<li>All components can be picked up with the exception of the
Windmill.</li>
<li>To pick up components, with a hammer in hand, look at the component
then press and hold Use(E).</li>
<li>Most components take no damage when picked up. Exceptions are the
Laser Light, Sound Light, Door Controller, Igniter, Auto Turret and
Tesla Coil. Batteries and Power Sources also take damage when picked
up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-traits"><a href="#common-traits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Common Traits</h2>
<p>These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs
and can only be crafted.</p>
<p>To change the colour of a wire/hose in place, with Wire/Hose Tool in
hand, hold Reload(R) to select the colour then look at an IO connection
and press Reload(R)</p>
<p>Wire length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points using the
left mouse button.</p>
<p>If you miss click and attach a hose/wire to the wall in the wrong
spot, look away and right click once. It will remove the last anchor
point. Hold the right mouse button down to clear the hose/wire.</p>
<p>To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point
and hold down the right mouse button.</p>
<p>When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed,
the hoses and wires will remain in place.</p>
<p>Wire Tracing: If you left click a pre wired connection, only that
connection will have the wire animation. The animation will return to
the rest of the wires after you take a couple steps or look at another
IO connection.</p>
<p>When trying to keep straight to get better hose/wire placement
accuracy, wear Diving Fins.</p>
<p>To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close
to an IO connection, in the F1 console, change client.lookatradius from
0.2 to 0.05. This lets you place anchor points closer to IO
connections.</p>
<p>If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding your Use
key, default is E. Hold Sprint, shift, to increase and Duck, ctrl, to
decrease. This will give your wires some slack rather than being
straight between 2 points.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wind Turbines operate in both day and night</li>
<li>The amount of power they output is heavily influenced by the number
of floors above the ground they are, not sea level</li>
<li>They will produce more power, more often the more floors above
ground you place them</li>
<li>Requires a 1x1 to be placed on and cannot be picked up with a
hammer</li>
<li>There is a small area at the base of the turbine, on some sheet
metal where you can place components.</li>
<li>A turbine made on an iceberg, will calculate its output based on the
height of the buildable ground of the iceberg below the turbine, down to
the ocean bottom. This means no additional height above an iceberg will
increase its height calculation.</li>

<p>Decay Time: 8 hours</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large Solar Panels output electricity only during the day.</li>
<li>They will produce less power if they are damaged or the Sun is not
making it to the entire front face.</li>
<li>They can be placed on the ground or flat building structure.</li>
<li>They can be picked up with a hammer but will lose 25% health.</li>

</ul>
<p><img src="images/image111.png" /></p>
<p>Depending on the time of year, the Sun will take a different path
through the sky. In June and July, the Sun reaches its most Northern
path. In December and January, the Sun reaches its most Southern path.
The picture above on the right shows how the Sun will traverse the sky
over 6 Rust months. A day in the game is an hour of real time. This
means it takes about 15 days for a full Rust Year. Wipe day is always
May 20th 2024 so depending how long or short your wipe is, and where on
the map you build, will determine the direction of your Solar Panels. If
you are only playing the first 3 days of a fresh wipe and you build in
the South, face the panels North and call it a day, but, if you are
playing a monthly wipe, placing them facing East and West is the
simplest option.</p>

class="anchor-link">*</a>Common Traits</h2>
<p>Batteries can accept incoming power at the same time they are sending
power out. Charging rate is dependent on the amount of power coming in,
with an efficiency of 80%. Example: 20rW from a Solar Panel * 0.8 = 16rW
usable through a battery.  Example: If your Medium Battery is supplying
16rW to a circuit, you want to give the battery a minimum of 20rW so it
doesn’t lose any charge. It is recommended to supply slightly more than
you need if you want to charge the battery. 1rW will charge a Large
Battery in 34 IRL days.</p>
<p>When a battery is depleted because it is not receiving enough power,
no power is output until it charges up for a couple seconds before
outputting to the connected circuit. The battery still not receiving
enough power will deplete in a second and the process repeats. If the
circuit after a battery is turning on and off, you do not have enough
power charging your batteries.</p>
<p>When they get picked up, they lose 25% HP but retain their current
capacity. This means if a large battery has a full charge, when you pick
it up and place it back down, it will still have a full charge.</p>
<p>Batteries have something called Active Usage and components have
something called Power Consumption. Active Usage is supposed to measure
the total amount of power a circuit is using and is used to calculate
the batteries discharge rate. What you will notice is that some
components will not consume any power but still register on a battery’s
active usage and vice versa, a component might consume power but not
register on a battery’s active usage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Power Distribution</p>
<p>Power distribution is one of the most important things to know and
understand when it comes to electricity. There are many ways to produce,
store and distribute power for your circuits. These systems can be
Centralized, Decentralized or a combination of both. This applies to
both the structure of the electrical grid and the physical placement of
the components inside your base.</p>
<p>A completely centralized system would root combine all power sources
to a single point and feed all components through a single power bus.
All of the components would be located in a singleroom/central spot.</p>
<p>A completely decentralized system would have separate power sources
for different circuits for different areas of a base. No 2 circuits
would share the same room or be located next to each other.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your base you may choose to use either or a
combination of both.</p>

<h1 id="the-structure-of-a-base-circuit"><a
href="#the-structure-of-a-base-circuit" class="anchor-link">*</a>The
Structure of a Base Circuit</h1>
<p>All circuits for a base follow the same basic structure. It
doesn’t matter if the base has 1 circuit or more, they all contain 4
main parts with a 5th part that does not have a static location. We have
the Power Source, Battery Backup, Distribution, End Devices/Circuits and
the 5th, Destruction Detection. Using the following flow chart we can
help <img src="images/image38.png" />illustrate this.</p>
<p>Moving top to bottom, every circuit needs a power source. You have 3
choices, Windmills, Solar Panels or Small Generators.</p>
<p>We then take our source power and feed it to a Battery Backup. You
have 2 choices, the Inline or Bypass(Nih Core). Either way, you must
ensure you are supplying enough power to keep your batteries
charged.</p>
<p>From the battery backup, we will then need to distribute the power to
the different systems in the base. There are 3 options, a Fixed or
Dynamic Bus or a Configure Siphon.</p>
<p>If you are working with Inline Battery Backup, you want to minimize a
battery’s Active Usage. If you are working with a Bypass Battery Backup,
you want to maximize the use of Consumable Power.</p>
<p>The End Devices and Circuits are your turrets, lights, cameras,
farms, sensor grids, ect. The Destruction Detection system should be
included in most circuits and if limited to one, placing one after the
battery backup is probably the best option.</p>

<p><img src="images/image86.png" /></p>
<p>This is when you directly connect what generates power to your
circuits. If your power source is destroyed or stops producing power for
any reason, your circuits will go offline. This method is a great
solution for short term uses like getting some auto turrets asap for
your clan or getting some water pumps online early for a berry farm.
While this method is good for a short time to get an early game
advantage, it is not recommended to rely on this method for any length
of time. We can introduce batteries to our circuits to create backup
power more suited for long term use.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to wire</li>
<li>Minimal components</li>
<li>Early game advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If power source is destroyed the components turn off</li>
<li>No backup power</li>
<li>Short term use only</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 main types of battery backups. Below we have the Inline,
OR/Blocker and Nih Core.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="inline"><a href="#inline" class="anchor-link">*</a>Inline</h2>
<p><img src="images/image26.png" /></p>
<p>Inline is the easiest way to give yourself a battery backup. This
method is fast to make and wire. It is reliable assuming you are
producing enough power to keep the batteries charged and it is an easy
way to decentralize your circuits. When you connect your power source
directly to your battery, 100% of that power is used for the sole
purpose of charging your battery. When your battery is fully charged,
any power above what is needed to maintain your battery’s charge is not
being used, which we call wasted. For example, a large battery under a
full load of 100, needs to be given 125 to prevent it from draining. If
you are giving your battery 150, there is 25 power that is not being
used. For 1 battery it doesn’t seem like a lot, but when you get into 4
or more batteries, that is 100 power being wasted. When the power source
stops making enough electricity, the battery will continue to supply
power until they are depleted or destroyed.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to make with minimal electrical components</li>
<li>Perfect for decentralizing circuits</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient use of power</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="orblocker"><a href="#orblocker"
class="anchor-link">*</a>OR/Blocker<img src="images/image32.png" /></h2>
<p>This method has been around for a long time and has been carried over
from a previous version of electricity when batteries could only charge
or discharge, not both at the same time. This is a ‘Bypass Distributor’
because your main circuit runs off the main power produced and the
excess power is used to charge the battery. While considered out of date
today for use as a primary battery backup system, with some small
modifications, it is useful as a secondary battery backup which we will
talk about later. The way this method works is by sending power into the
first electrical branch and branching out enough power to meet your
circuit’s needs. That power is passed to an OR Switch which sends power
to your circuit. The extra electricity from the first electrical branch
is sent to another electrical branch. Power is branched out to block the
Blocker which prevents the battery from draining. The extra power is
then used to charge the battery. When there is not enough power to keep
the battery blocked, the battery sends power out to the OR Switch to
keep your circuits online. Based on the picture above, if the windmill
only produces 75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the
first electrical branch or block the battery. The battery takes over
powering your circuit but the 75 power is still coming out of the first
electrical branch. The power is still there, it is just not being used,
it is wasted.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand</li>
<li>Simple to build</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using battery power</li>
<li>Ignores the battery update to allow charging and discharging at the
same time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="secondary-battery-backup"><a href="#secondary-battery-backup"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Secondary Battery Backup</h2>
<p>A secondary battery backup is a way to provide power to a circuit
after the main backup system  goes offline. It’s a backup of a backup so
the chance that it gets used on a typical day is near 0. Using the
picture below, we will break down how it works.</p>
<p><img src="images/image109.png" /> </p>
<p>We are using a Test Generator to represent a fixed power source so
power levels won’t go up or down like wind and solar. The power will
either be there or it will not. We install the battery pre charged.
Replacing the generator with a fixed amount of power from your main
circuit, which has a built-in battery backup already, makes this battery
a secondary backup. In coming power does not fluctuate. It is either
present or it is not. When the power is no longer present, the battery
takes over. The chance this battery is needed should be very low so the
chance we need to recharge it is very low so we don’t provide the
battery any power.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses only a few components so it’s easy to build and wire</li>
<li>Efficient for redundant backup power</li>
<li>Can be inserted into almost any circuit at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using a dynamic power source</li>
<li>Requires a pre charged battery</li>
<li>Added costs for redundancy  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="nih-core"><a href="#nih-core" class="anchor-link">*</a>Nih
Core</h2>
<p><img src="images/image87.png" /></p>
<p>The Nih Core is the modern version of and replacement for the
OR/Blocker and is really meant to be used with 2 or more batteries. This
method takes advantage of changes that were made to batteries that
allows them to charge and discharge at the same time. The key component
is the Memory Cell which lets us redirect the main power to the battery
when there is not enough power to keep the battery blocked. Starting at
the power source, it is connected to an electrical branch to branch out
enough power to meet your circuit’s needs. That power is sent to the
Memory Cell which sends the power up to the OR Switch and on to your
circuit. The extra electricity from the first electrical branch is sent
to another electrical branch and enough power is branched out to a
Splitter to SET and RESET the Memory Cell as well as block the Blocker
to prevent the battery from draining. The extra power from the second
Electrical Branch is sent to a second OR Switch and used to charge the
battery. When there is not enough power to keep the Splitter powered,
the Memory Cell will switch sending power from Output to Inverted
Output. This reroutes power away from the first OR Switch to the second
OR Switch which charges the battery. The battery is also unblocked to
keep your circuit online. Based on the picture above, if the windmill
only produces 75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the
first electrical branch which means the splitter loses power. When the
Splitter loses power, it first stops sending power to SET on the Memory
Cell. Power is still going to RESET in that moment so the Memory Cell
flips outputs. RESET loses power followed by the Block Passthrough on
the Blocker. The battery takes over powering your circuit and the 75
power that is still going through the first electrical branch and memory
cell is now sent to the battery extending its life instead of being
wasted.</p>
<p>If you notice that power is flickering off/on when switching between
main power and battery power, it is because 1 of 2 issues. If using only
1 battery, add a Root Combiner between the battery and blocker to keep
the battery active. If using more than 1 battery,  add 1 or 2 components
between the Memory Cells Power Out and the OR Switch. This will give the
circuit a chance to provide battery power before the Memory Cell flips
outputs.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less wasted electricity when on battery</li>
<li>Utilizes the battery’s ability to charge and discharge at the same
time</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>More components, more wiring.</li>
<li>Added complexity</li>
<li>Power flickers when changing states</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="centralized-vs-decentralized"><a
href="#centralized-vs-decentralized"
class="anchor-link">*</a>*Centralized vs Decentralized</h1>
<p>Locations</p>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing electricity, we are
talking about 1 of 2 things. We are either talking about the physical
placement of components or we are talking about power flow from a source
to the end component. A 100% completely centralized system, the
electrical circuit would collect, store and distribute power all through
a single circuit and all of this would be located in a single electrical
room/area. A 100% completely decentralized system would have independent
circuits with their own power source, battery backup, and distribution
located in different rooms/areas for each system and section of a base.
These 2 concepts exist on the extreme ends of a spectrum. The best
circuit does not need to be one or the other, it can be located anywhere
in between. There are several variables including the server, wipe
length, group size, the base, server limits and electrical experience
that will influence the solution that works for your situation. This is
not a 1 size fits all. The best circuit is the one that does the job you
need in the time you need it.</p>
<p>First we will talk about the physical placement then we will get into
the electrical circuit(s).</p>
<p>When talking about centralizing or decentralizing the physical
location of components, it should be understood that we are NOT talking
about the auto turrets on the roof for defense. We are NOT talking about
the quality of life improvements of having electric heaters everywhere
because the build location was in the arctic biome. We are NOT talking
about the components placed on walls for the purpose of destruction
detection. What we are talking about is the location of the core
components. We are talking about all the circuits that power, control
and support the defensive systems, monitoring systems or quality of life
systems. We are talking about the location of collection points for
power sources, battery backups, the batteries, power buses and all the
logic circuits for everything electric in a base. We are talking about
the location a Windmill sends its power to or the place where the wire
that powers the auto turret comes from.  </p>
<h2 id="centralized-location"><a href="#centralized-location"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Location</h2>
<p><img src="images/image37.png" /></p>
<p>Where you place these components is very important because you don’t
want to make it easy for raiders to destroy them. You want to protect
your circuits like you protect your TC. Centralizing the placement of
these components in a single room or area is very convenient. It’s easy
to add layers of honeycomb, add lots of traps and doors to protect but
can come at the potential risk that if raiders get into this room/area,
with 1 rocket they can destroy and disable everything. You could place
it in a spot raiders would not think to or want to raid. When
centralizing, the location should not be an afterthought. It should be
preplanned into the base.</p>
<p>No matter where the room is, hiding the wires that will need to lead
to and from this room is a must. They should be either hidden out of
sight or mislead the raiders as to the rooms location. Wires are limited
in length so in smaller bases, it is much easier to reach all the
components outside the room, like auto turrets, without requiring extra
components to extend the wire. In larger bases, this can become a
problem if you don’t have a safe place to put components to extend the
wires. A safe place should not be easier to destroy than the end
component itself. As an example, if you are using a memory cell to
extend a wire to an auto turret. The memory cell should not be easier to
destroy than the auto turret it connects to.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decentralized-locations"><a href="#decentralized-locations"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Locations</h2>
<p><img src="images/image107.jpg" /></p>
<p>Decentralizing the physical locations of circuits is where there are
2 or more electrical rooms/areas. These locations should be hard to find
and harder to raid. These locations could be rooms that raiders would
think is worth raiding. The more rooms there are, the less likely
raiders will disable every system when cutting the base in half with
rockets. The larger the base is, the easier it should be spreading out
the electrical rooms/areas. The more spread out these locations are
could lead to more wiring back and forth but not necessarily.</p>
<p>Hiding your wires is very important. Any information a raider can
collect about the locations of your electrical rooms should be
minimized. With the limitation of wire length, decentralizing can be an
excellent way of distributing power closer to where it is actually
needed. Eliminating the need to use wire extensions makes things more
secure and builders won’t need to build in extra rooms just for this.
These locations could be anywhere but it is recommended you plan them
into the build for more security. Electrical rooms should not be an
afterthought just like the disconnected TC was not an afterthought.</p>
<hr />
<p>Circuits</p>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing circuits, we are
talking about how we are delivering power from the source to the
different systems and end components. It is crucial to understand the
structure of a base circuit because it makes it easier to visualize the
difference between Centralized and Decentralized circuits. To help
explain this, we will use 3 different end devices/circuits. First - Auto
Turrets, Second - A HBHF grid to know where enemies are and Third -
Lights.</p>
<p>Centralized is a single system with all power sources, destruction
detection, batteries, power distribution and end systems connected in a
single circuit. To be more specific, all power sources get combined and
run through a destruction detector into a battery backup system. From
the battery back up we provide all of the end devices and circuits with
a single distribution system.</p>
<p><img src="images/image70.png" /></p>
<p>Decentralized is when we provide all of our end systems with their
own power source, destruction detection(optional), battery and power
distribution. Decentralization is a concept that exists on a spectrum.
On one extreme it could be as simple as cutting the base in half and
using 1 circuit for the North and 1 for the South or putting the turrets
on 1 circuit and keeping the HBHF and lights on another. On the other
extreme end we break every end system down as far as we want. Lets start
with auto turrets and lets say we have 15 of them. 3 per side, North,
South, East and West as well as 3 on the roof. That could be 5 separate
circuits. 5 separate power sources with 5 different detectors, 5 battery
backups and 5 separate distributors. Then we could also do the same with
the HBHF grind. Separate that into 5 circuits. Destruction detection
could be included in all of those circuits and separate stand alone
systems could be added for all the walls on each of the 4 sides. Even
the lights if you wanted to could be decentralized.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" /></p>
<p>Knowing ahead of time what systems your base will use, how much power
they consume, the size of the base and the environment being played in
(competitive vs casual), will influence your design. For best results,
design the base build around your circuits so you never need to
sacrifice functionality or security.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="centralized-circuits"><a href="#centralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Here we can look at some examples of a centralized circuit. Like we
stated before, the idea is to combine everything into a single circuit.
These have the advantage of being less complex but at the disadvantage
of having single points of failure. The first circuit we can look at in
the image below is pretty simple. We have a single source of power
feeding an inline battery backup supplying power to our end components
and circuits through a single distributor. We are starting with an
inline backup because it does not scale efficiently in a centralized
environment and it is easier to see points of failure. If the battery
gets destroyed or if the first Electrical Branch gets taken out, the
entire system goes offline.</p>
<p><img src="images/image65.png" /></p>
<p>The trick with an Inline system is to produce enough power to keep
your battery charged but not produce so much that power is wasted. A
large battery needs a constant input of 125 to not drain if its Active
Usage is maxed out at 100. With an input of 127, it will take that
battery 34 days to fully charge from empty. Always try to precharge the
batteries above 3,000rWm before letting them power the circuit. Anything
above what’s needed to maintain the battery will be a waste of power
when the battery is full.</p>
<p>When a circuit requires more than 100 power, and the goal is still to
centralize, switch to a bypass system like the Nih Core and max out your
batteries potential. If the amount of reliable power that can be
produced is limited, the goal should be to minimize the battery’s Active
Usage to a state that is manageable. The lower it is, the less power
needed to maintain the battery and the longer it will last when main
power is gone. Refer to the section titled Battery Active Usage Vs
Actual Power Consumed for a better understanding of the 2 game
mechanics.</p>
<p>This next example uses the same end systems but has multiple power
sources and multiple batteries to support the same or more components.
It uses the Nih Core bypass battery backup and provides power to all the
different end systems through a single distributor. The number of end
systems you want to run and the amount of power they will consume will
dictate how much power you need to generate and the number of batteries
you need to support everything in the event of a power outage. If your
circuit needs 160rW, we will use 2 large batteries. If we need 470rw, we
will use 5 large batteries. DO NOT mix and match battery sizes.</p>
<p> <img src="images/image12.png" /></p>
<p>Before it was said that the above example could support the same or
more components. The Nih Core really is meant to scale up to larger
power demands but lets say the demand is only 100, that means we have
built in some redundancy. 1 turbine or battery could be destroyed and
the circuit would still function as normal. This is an expensive way of
having redundancy but it does work. This is meant to be easily scalable
to any size power load but once we start to root combine batteries, we
should try to maximize the combined batteries potential by consuming as
much as possible. This means that if we have 2 large batteries, we
should try to use as much of the 200rW as possible. When batteries get
root combined, they do not share the load as one would expect.</p>
<p>For example, we have a circuit with 2 large batteries supporting a
load of 50. It would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2
batteries equals 25 per battery, but rustricity doesn’t work like that.
That 50 power is taken from both batteries and is seen as Active Usage.
<img src="images/image128.png" /></p>
<p>This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage. Active Usage is
used to calculate how fast a battery drains. If we are forcing batteries
to max drain then we might as well try to use as much as the combined
power the batteries will provide.</p>
<p>It is never good practice to mix and match different size batteries.
A large battery will last 4 hours, a medium battery will last 3 hours
and small batteries will last 15 minutes. If you mix and match, you can
only rely on maximum power for the amount of time the smallest battery
will last. For example, 2 large batteries and 1 medium for a total of
250rW. For only 3 hours will you get 250, the last hour will only
provide 200. There are situations where mixing is useful, but not for
the main battery backup on a centralized circuit.</p>
<p>Centralized circuits are simple, easy to work with and scalable. On
paper, you can make a centralized circuit very large and consume a lot
of power. The reality is to produce a lot and store a lot of power, you
will need a lot of land to build it on. In this next example, on paper,
we have 9 turbines on the 10th floor with 9 backup batteries feeding 36
auto turrets divided by 9 per North, South, East and West sides. It also
has 3 HBHF Sensors per side, Search Lights on each side and a bunch of
lights. The circuit is only an example and is not using its full power
potential. It could include a grid of tesla coils, destruction
detection, a camera network, automatic doors, TC/Vending Machine and
storage monitoring, an indoor garden, a system that makes your base look
online when you are offline and much more. The point here is size, very
large.</p>
<p><img src="images/image58.png" /></p>
<p>It is not so easy to see, with a circuit this large, and the ability
to be much larger, how one would go abouts physically building this. It
would be possible to centralize the location of the battery backup and
distribution but the size of the base will probably call for multiple
wire extensions. Any component can be used to extend a wire. The idea is
to make that component as cheap as possible. Only consuming 1 power and
being the resource cheapest component is the Industrial Lights. They are
easy to integrate as base lighting giving them the perfect camouflage.
Decentralizing the locations of a centralized circuit is possible but
difficult especially on large bases. At a certain point, you may find it
easier to just decentralize the circuit itself along with the locations.

<h2 id="decentralized-circuits"><a href="#decentralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Decentralizing circuits really comes down to how extreme you want to
take it. The idea behind decentralizing is adding security by segmenting
different systems and areas with their own independent powers supplies
and backups. Keep in mind, the type of battery backup you choose is up
to you but for our examples, we will stick with inlines because it takes
up less room in the pictures.</p>
<p>The first example shows decentralizing by separating the different
end circuits with independent power supplies and battery backups. The
Auto Turrets get their own power supply and inline battery. Same for the
SAM sites, interior lights, exterior lights and HBHF grid, they all have
their own power supply and inline battery backup.</p>
<p><img src="images/image55.png" /></p>
<p>While decentralizing based on end circuits is an option, if the
battery powering that circuit gets destroyed, that entire circuit will
become disabled. Having all your auto turrets go offline during a raid
is never a good thing. A more secure option would be to decentralize by
location. To keep the idea simple for the next example, lets breakup a
base into 5 sections, North, South, East, West and the roof. By giving
each group their own power supply and backup, it prevents the entire
base from going offline when raiders destroy both the power supply and
battery backup. Decentralizing the circuit makes it a lot easier to
decentralize the locations. Wire length is limited, so depending on the
size of the base, being able to put the power source, battery backup and
distribution in a location that minimizes the need to wire extensions is
very appealing. If the base is of a smaller size, putting the power
supply, battery backup and distribution on the North side that powers
the South side has the clear advantage that in the event raiders come
through the South side, when they hit the electrical room on the South
side, it only disables the North side of the base. It is recommended
that when needing to extend wires, if you cant put the extension
component in a protected area, use an industrial light and integrate it
into your base lighting.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-power-bus"><a href="#what-is-a-power-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>What is a Power Bus?*</h1>
<p><img src="images/image127.png" /></p>
<p>A power bus is a group of components with the sole purpose of
directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that perform
specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot like the
breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your electricity.
Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or purpose, like
the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. A power bus also helps
prioritize the order in which circuits receive power. In the event you
are producing less power then you need, you have built in control over
which circuit is last to go offline. We have 3 types of power buses,
fixed and dynamic.</p>
<h2 id="fixed-bus-f-bus"><a href="#fixed-bus-f-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Fixed Bus (F-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image115.png" /></p>
<p>A fixed bus is when you dedicate a specific amount of power per
output. Electrical Branches are required to dedicate the amount of power
to a specific amount. This type of power bus always consumes the amount
of power each output is set to even if nothing is attached to the
connection point.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-bus-d-bus"><a href="#dynamic-bus-d-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image51.png" /></p>
<p>A dynamic bus is when we let the components evenly distribute between
all connected outputs. The only control you have over the amount of
power available to each output is the amount of power you give it. This
is primarily used when the component or circuit attached to each output
requires the same amount of power.</p>

<h1 id="battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"><a
href="#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"
class="anchor-link">*</a>*Battery Active Usage Vs Actual Power
Consumed</h1>
<p>The simple explanation is, Active Usage is the amount of power the
battery is draining by. When you look at the battery with a wire tool,
you will see Active Usage. It is reasonable to think that the number you
see is the amount of power your circuit is currently consuming, but it’s
not always the case. Even when some components are turned off and not
consuming power, they still add to a battery’s active usage. Power
Consumed is the reduction of available power after passing through a
component. An electric heater consumes 3, if 100 goes in we get 97
coming out. For almost all components, the consumed power = active
usage, this is a 1:1. The electrical branch is the only component that
does not register an active usage for itself and only for what is
branched out.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="short-circuit-max-depth"><a href="#short-circuit-max-depth"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit / Max Depth</h1>
<p>This is a single message that is displayed for 2 different errors. At
the time of creating this section, XOR Switches did not consume any
power which is why you will see them used in the pictures. The pictures
might get remade in time but power consumption is not important when
discussing and understanding this error.</p>
<p>Short Circuit</p>
<p>A short circuit happens when you have power feeding back into itself,
AKA, a loop.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image124.png" /></p>
<p>Why would you do this? You wouldn’t. In the past, batteries
functioned differently and there was a need to create the “Infinite
Power Loop”. Today, batteries have something called “Active Usage”. This
breaks the infinite loop and eliminates a need for it to exist.</p>
<p>You can circumvent a short circuit by increasing the number of
components in the loop to be 9 or greater.<img
src="images/image10.png" /></p>
<p>In the next picture we show a battery feeding power back into
itself.<img src="images/image62.png" /></p>
<p>There is no reason to do this anymore. There was a time when
batteries could only exist in 1 state at a time. They were either
charging or discharging and when they were discharging, they were always
doing it at their max. Back then, people found a way to use the extra
power and send it back to the battery. For example, a large battery was
always outputting 100 power whereas today, they calculate an active
usage and only drain the amount of power a circuit needs, up to 100.
Today, if the circuit only needs 50, the battery only gives 50.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is batteries also cause an active usage. For
a large battery, it is 400, so in the above loop, you are forcing a max
drain on the battery. There is no advantage to this.</p>
<p>Max Depth</p>
<p>Maximum Depth is referring to the number of components between your
power source and the  Root Combiner. A Max Depth error will occur when
we exceed 16 components. <img src="images/image101.png" /></p>
<p>It is important to understand this mechanic and how to calculate it.
This becomes important when combining multiple power sources including a
battery backup with multiple combined batteries. If you experience this
error, to calculate the depth of a circuit, we start with the last Root
Combiner or the combiner that is furthest away from the power source and
count the number of components power must pass through all the way back
to the power source. This limits where in a circuit you can use Root
Combiners.</p>
<p>The below images are 2 ways root combiners can be stacked. The group
on the left is known as pyramid stacking and the group on the right is
known as a daisy chain. While both groups are possible, you can see that
the group on the left is only 4 components deep whereas the right side
is 8 deep. This is important when working with a large amount of
centralized power because you can quickly use up the depth and then not
be able to have the number of batteries you want or need.</p>
<p><img src="images/image7.png" /></p>
<p>In this next image, we have 8 Windmills combined into a Nih Core with
a battery backup containing 6 Large Batteries. This circuit has a total
depth of 13 components. The trick to counting depth is counting the
components in the longest route from the last Root Combiner, #1 back to
the Windmill, #13.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image99.png" /></p>
<p>In the next example, we have 2 isolated power sources. The first
source is the cluster of Windmills. The second is the combined Solar
Panels for the Component Destruction Detector. This means that we have 2
paths we must consider when calculating the depth. The first path to
look at is the one that goes from the Root Combiner #1 back to the
Windmill #14. This path is the main power path. The second path goes
from Root Combiner #1 back to the Solar Panel #16. If one of these paths
exceed the Max Depth limit of 16 components, you will start to see the
error message at Root Combiner #1.</p>
<p><img src="images/image50.png" /></p>
<p>The next image shows a Max Depth using an equal number of Windmills
and Batteries with a Nih Core.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="side-inputs"><a href="#side-inputs"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Side Inputs</h2>
<p>They are not bugged or broken, you just dont know how to use them
yet.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people to think of ‘Switch On’ and ‘Switch
Off’ as a toggle like on the side of a Timer. They are not toggles, they
are inputs with an added function. Just like the input on the bottom,
the side inputs also pass power through to the top. The function part
only functions when power is received.</p>
<p>When any input on the Switch receives an ‘update’, the Switch will
bind to that input for its source of power that passes through to the
top. It will remain bound to that input until another input updates
which will force the switch to bind to the new input. An update is
either losing power or receiving power, 0-1 or 1-0 or power levels
change up or down.</p>
<p>The exception to this is when one input is receiving power and
another receives the same amount of power, the Switch will not recognize
the new source and remain bound to the previous input.</p>
<p>The following pictures will help illustrate how it works.</p>
<p>Starting off, we are using 3 Switches to provide 3 different amounts
of power each input. Green wire is for Switch On. Red wire is for Switch
Off. Black wire is for Electric Input on the bottom. Yellow lines mark
the path power is taking. Red lines mark where power stops. In this
first picture, we are sending power to the bottom input and the Switch
sends it out the top, with the expected power loss.</p>
<p>Next, we leave power going into the bottom and then apply power to
Switch Off. As we can see, the Switch will flip off.<img
src="images/image41.png" /></p>
<p><img src="images/image13.png" /></p>
<p>If we manually flip the Switch back on, we can now see a new amount
of power displaying on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image75.png" /></p>
<p>This is because the Switch is now bound to the Switch Off input for
the power that passes through to the top. The power going into the
bottom input is completely ignored. For the next picture, we flip the
Switch back off and then apply power to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image64.png" /></p>
<p>The Switch will now flip on and once again pass through a new amount
of power to the counter. The power going to the bottom input or Switch
Off input is now ignored and the Switch is bound to Switch On. In the
next picture, we remove power from Switch On while keeping power applied
to Switch Off and the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="images/image30.png" /></p>
<p>We can see here now that power was removed from Switch On, the Switch
has no power. The green light turns off and the Switch is still in the
on position. Even tho the other 2 inputs have power, the Switch is bound
to Switch On for its source of power, which was removed. If we restore
power to Switch On, the Switch will start passing power though again
like the previous picture. With power restored, for the next picture we
will remove power from Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image44.png" /></p>
<p>We restored power to Switch On before removing power from Switch Off.
The green light turns off when power is removed and the Switch binds to
the Switch Off. This is because that input received an update from
‘having power’ to ‘not having power’, from 1 to 0. For the next picture,
we restore power to Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image53.png" /></p>
<p>Restoring power to the Switch Off input, the red light turns on and
the Switch flips to the off position. When we manually flip it on we can
see the new amount of power passing through.</p>
<p><img src="images/image105.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing that we only have 28 power showing on the counter, it is clear
power is coming through the Switch Off input. When we remove power from
the bottom input, the Switch loses power.</p>
<p><img src="images/image73.png" /></p>
<p>It loses power because the bottom input was updated, from 1 to 0, so
the Switch binded to it. Now bound to the bottom input and not receiving
power, the green light turns off and no power passes through. Restoring
power to the bottom input, the green light turns back on and the new
power amount is displayed on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image126.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing the power level on the counter confirming power is coming into
the bottom, we will now adjust the Electrical Branch to send more power
to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image116.png" /></p>
<p>After increasing the amount of power, we can see an instant change on
the counter to reflect that the Switch changed the input it was bound to
from the bottom input to Switch On.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whichever is the last input to receive an update is
the input the Switch will bind to for its source of power. Adding power,
removing power or a change in power levels will update the Switches
input. When moving power from one input to another, it is important</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aka, a D-Type Flip Flop</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The Reset input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Inverted Output</li>
<li>The Set input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Output</li>
<li>The Toggle input will cause the Memory Cell to switch the output
which power is going through</li>
<li>The side inputs are prioritized from top to bottom. This means if
power is applied to Set when power is applied to Reset or Toggle,
nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset when power is applied
to Toggle, nothing will happen, but, if power is applied to Set, it will
override Reset and force the Memory Cell to send power through
Output</li>
<li>When switching from one output to the other, power will pass through
the new output first before removing power from the old output</li>
<li>The 2 outputs are currently bugged. When you try to see the power
info by pointing at the outputs with a Wire Tool, it will show the
incoming power being evenly split between both outputs. This is a visual
bug. 100% of the power is only coming out of 1 of the outputs</li>

<ul>
<li>Holding ‘E’ with a wire tool will let you configure the counter. The
options are Set Target and Show Passthrough</li>
<li>Set Target lets you pick a number between 1 and 100. When the
counter is equal to the target number, or greater, the counter will pass
power through</li>
<li>Show Passthrough will show the amount of incoming power.</li>
<li>When power is applied to Increment Counter, the Counter will count
up by 1</li>
<li>When power is applied to Decrement Counter, the Counter will count
down by 1</li>
<li>When power is applied to Clear Counter, the Counter will reset back
to 0</li>
<li>The Counter does not need power to count up, down or be cleared</li>
<li>When set to Show Passthrough, if it only shows 1, connect the
Passthrough (output) to any input on any component. This will cause the
counter to actually pass power through so it can show the amount.</li>
<li>Using a Counter on the floor on its thin side, within a 1 meter
radius, if an item like a furnace or sleeping bag is removed, the
Counter will also disappear. When placing or removing building
structures, the Counter will also disappear.</li>
<li>The following items can be placed on top of a counter that is placed
down on its thin side: Lantern, Jackolanterns, carvable pumpkins,
sandbag and concrete barricades, pookie bear, twitch trophy, eggs and
the small candle. Placing multiple counters together to create a larger
pad, you can put larger things like a small battery on top.</li>

<p>Active Usage: 1</p>
<p>Power Consumption: 1rW per input but none for itself</p>
<p>Despawn Time: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change strobe settings. Look at the
light and hold USE(E) to change the frequency of the strobe between
10hz, 20hz and 40hz or to manually turn it on.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the light. For example, if you send constant power
to TURN ON, the light turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the light
will turn off. When you remove power from TURN OFF, the light will not
turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. You will need to
remove and reapply power to TURN ON for the light to turn back on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the light on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If you apply power to TOGGLE, the light will turn on. While the
light is on, if you send power to TURN OFF, the light will turn off.
When you remove power from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE,
the light will not turn back on. On the other hand if you send power to
TURN ON, the light will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the light
will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, we remove power from
TOGGLE and the light will turn off. This is because when you remove
power from TOGGLE, it tells the light to turn off.</li>
<li>They take damage when active at a rate of 1hp/3min42sec</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the
ground</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp</li>

<p>Low Grade Fuel Capacity: 500</p>
<p>Low Grade Fuel Consumption: 1/min when active or 10/min when set to
Motion</p>
<p>Despawn Time: 5 minutes</p>
<p>Decay Time: 96 hours</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market</li>
<li>When Active, it creates a fog cloud in front of it that covers an
area equal to a 2x2 and is thickest below half height walls. Consumes
low grade fuel at 1 per minute.</li>
<li>When set to Motion, it only gets set off by non authorized players
and will emit fog every couple seconds creating a thicker cloud directly
in front of it. Setting the fogger at a half wall height, the constant
emission of the fogger creates a thick cloud at eye level. Consumes low
grade fuel at 10 per minute.</li>
<li>The fogger only emits a cloud as long as the non authorized player
is moving. If the player stops moving, the fogger turns off.</li>
<li>A cloud takes 5 seconds to form and 40 seconds to disappear.</li>
<li>Increasing the number of foggers increases the density of the cloud.
4 foggers is enough to block the light from fire and 5 will block light
from electrical lighting.</li>
<li>Fog will fall toward the ground and accumulate on any horizontal
surface. The higher the fogger the thinner the cloud.</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
hold USE(E) to Activate, Open or turn on Motion.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the fogger. For example, if you send constant
power to TURN ON, the fogger turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the
fogger will turn off. When you remove power from TURN OFF, the fogger
will not turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. You will
need to remove and reapply power to TURN ON for the fogger to turn back
on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the fogger on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If you apply power to TOGGLE, the fogger will turn on. While the
fogger is on, if you send power to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off.
When you remove power from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE,
the fogger will not turn back on. On the other hand if you send power to
TURN ON, the fogger will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the
fogger will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, we remove power
from TOGGLE and the fogger will turn off. This is because when you
remove power from TOGGLE, it tells the fogger to turn off.</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the
ground</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp</li>

<p>It is a system that lets you collect, store, transport and distribute
water in game. It functions similarly to the electrical system in that
it has its own hand tool and you connect components in the same way.</p>
<p>Its primary use is for farming plants like hemp, berries and other
foods.</p>
<p>Gravity is something you will need to be aware of. When sending water
down towards the ground, gravity will assist you. If at any point you
need to route water up away from the ground, you will require a

only appears to happen with the Electrical Branch, 10 for the Branch and
10 for the Boom Box Toggle. If you replace it with a Splitter, the
