<p><em>you are the <span id="visitorcount"></span>th visitor !</em></p>
<hr />
<p>This is a work in progress, everything is subject to change, be
reorganised or moved to some other sub pages, but any info still valid
in game wont be removed.</p>
<p>All of the information you find here is comming from a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Doc file by <span class="citation"
data-cites="SwiftCoyote#2007">@SwiftCoyote#2007</span></a>, so thanks to
him and all the people in the Rustricity Workshop community that
contribute to it!</p>
<p>A massive Thank You to <span class="citation"
data-cites="3YE#6593">@3YE#6593</span> on Discord for creating the
website and teaching me (SwiftCoyote) how to update and maintain it.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to contribute to this project, there is multiple way you
can do it by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding a bug, spelling or grammaitical error, or making a
suggestion, please make them on the Google Document - <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hr2dKtooN_YDF7TUsTdpLGadEEy9iyEFp12wbPnIas/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Document</a><br />
</li>
<li>You could contribute code that fix or add to the website,</li>
<li>But the principal thing is the accuracy of the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its made in a way so someone could edit the website content without
needing to know html/css/javascript. All the content is writen in
markdown format (similar to discord messages: *<em>italic</em>*,
**<strong>bold</strong>**, etc…) For now, I havent written something
that explains how to do it but you can ask <span class="citation"
data-cites="3YE#6593">@3YE#6593</span> on Discord for more
information.</p>

<h1 id="tools"><a href="#tools" class="anchor-link">*</a>Tools</h1>
<hr />
<p>These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs
and can only be crafted.</p>
<p>To change the colour of a wire/hose/pipe in place, with
Wire/Hose/Pipe Tool in hand, hold Reload <code>R</code> to select the
colour then look at an IO connection and press Reload <code>R</code></p>
<p>Wire/Hose/Pipe length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points
using the left mouse button.</p>
<p>If you miss click and attach a hose/wire/pipe to the wall in the
wrong spot, look away and right click once. It will remove the last
anchor point. Hold the right mouse button down to clear the
hose/wire.</p>
<p>To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point
and hold down the right mouse button.</p>
<p>Holding ‘Left Shift’ allows you to place anchor points on deployed
entities like boxes or chairs (Only Pipes ATM)</p>
<p>When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed,
the hoses and wires will remain in place.</p>
<p><span id="pipe-break"> But pipes will break ! they can also break
when doing anything that change the hitbox of the thing they are placed
on, ie: upgrading walls can break pipe ! </span></p>
<p>Wire Tracing: If you left click a pre wired connection, only that
connection will have the wire animation. The animation will return to
the rest of the wires after you take a couple steps or look at another
IO connection.</p>
<p>When trying to keep straight to get better hose/wire placement
accuracy, wear Diving Fins.</p>
<p>To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close
to an IO connection, in the F1 console, change
<code>client.lookatradius</code> from <code>0.2</code> to
<code>0.05</code>. This lets you place anchor points closer to IO
connections.</p>
<p>If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding your Use
key, default is <code>E</code>. Hold Sprint, shift, to increase and
Duck, ctrl, to decrease. This will give your wires some slack rather
than being straight between 2 points.</p>

<li>Wind Turbines operate in both day and night</li>
<li>The amount of power they output is heavily influenced by the number
of floors above the ground they are, not sea level</li>
<li>They will produce more power, more often the more floors above
ground you place them</li>
<li>Requires a 1x1 to be placed on and cannot be picked up with a
hammer</li>
<li>Requires a single square or 2 triangles to be placed on and cannot
be picked up with a hammer.</li>
<li>There is a small area at the base of the turbine, on some sheet
metal where you can place components.</li>
<li>A turbine made on an iceberg, will calculate its output based on sea
level down to the ocean bottom. This means no additional height above
sea level will increase its height calculation.</li>
<li>There needs to be a minimum of 3 foundations distance between
turbines. This will prevent 1 turbine blocking the wind for
another.</li>

<li>Large Solar Panels output electricity only during the day.</li>
<li>They will produce less power if they are damaged or the Sun is not
making it to the entire front face.</li>
<li>They can be placed on the ground or flat building structure.</li>
<li>They can be picked up with a hammer but will lose 25% health.</li>

<p>Depending on the time of year, the Sun will take a different path
through the sky. In June and July, the Sun reaches its most Northern
path. In December and January, the Sun reaches its most Southern path.
The picture above on the right shows how the Sun will traverse the sky
over 6 Rust months. A day in the game is an hour of real time. This
means it takes about 15 days for a full Rust Year. Wipe day is always
May 20th 2024 so depending how long or short your wipe is, and where on
the map you build, will determine the direction of your Solar Panels. If
you are only playing the first 3 days of a fresh wipe and you build in
the South, face the panels North and call it a day, but, if you are
playing a monthly wipe, placing them facing East and West is the
simplest option.</p>

<hr />
<p>Power distribution is one of the most important things to know and
understand when it comes to electricity.<br />
There are many ways to produce, store and distribute power for your
circuits.<br />
This section breaks down the components used for distribution and the
different types of distribution circuits known as a power bus.<br />
It covers the different types of battery backup systems.<br />
It covers the difference between the amount of power a circuit consumes
versus what a battery thinks it is consuming, aka active usage.<br />
This section also covers the theory behind circuit and location
centralization, decentralization and hybridization.<br />
It covers the game mechanics behind circuit delay and power flow as well
as the error message, short circuit/max depth.</p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li>Batteries can accept incoming power at the same time they are
sending power out.<br />
</li>
<li>Charging rate is dependent on the amount of power coming in, with an
efficiency of 80%.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> 20rW from a Solar Panel × 0.8 = 16rW usable through
a battery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example:</em> If your Medium Battery is supplying 16rW to a
circuit, 16 ÷ 0.8 = 20rW is the minimum you want to give the battery so
it doesn’t lose any charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to supply slightly more than you need if you want
to charge the battery.<br />
</li>
<li>When you combine batteries with Root Combiners, they do not split
the load as one would expect. They cannot see each other, so each
battery tries to power the whole circuit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, in a circuit with 2 root combined batteries supporting a
load of 50, it would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2
batteries equals 25 per battery.<br />
Rustricity doesn’t work like that and 50 power is taken from each
battery and seen as Active Usage on both batteries. This means both
batteries are draining at a rate of 50.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage, which is used to
calculate how fast a battery drains. So if we are forcing batteries to
max drain, then we might as well try to use as much as the combined
power the batteries will provide.</p>
<p>When using a bypass battery backup like the <a
href="backup.html#nih-core">Nih core</a>, Active Usage does not matter
because the circuits are power from the main power source most of the
time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rustricity has its own version of <a
href="concepts.html#parallel-vs-series">Parallel and Series</a> battery
configurations.</li>
<li>1rw will charge a Large Battery in 34 IRL days.</li>
<li>When a battery is depleted because it is not receiving enough power,
no power is outputed until it charges up for a couple seconds before
outputting to the connected circuit. The battery still not receiving
enough power will deplete in a second and the process repeats.<br />
</li>
<li>If the circuit after a battery is turning on and off, you do not
have enough power charging your batteries.</li>
<li>When they get picked up, they lose 25% HP but retain their current
capacity. This means if a large battery has a full charge, when you pick
it up and place it back down, it will still have a full charge.</li>
<li>Batteries have something called Active Usage and components have
something called Power Consumption. Read about it in <a
href="concepts.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed</a>.</li>

<h1 id="nih-capacitor-unfinished"><a href="#nih-capacitor-unfinished"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Nih Capacitor <em>(unfinished)</em></h1>
<p><strong>( will probably be fixed and wont work anymore soon
)</strong></p>
<p>The Nih Capacitor was first established by Nih, with assistance from
SwiftCoyote, on September 11, 2022. A Capacitor is a set of components
that accumulate power, much like rechargeable batteries. However, the
method for assessing the amount of stored power differs.</p>
<p>For batteries, the stored power is represented as
<code>Capacity</code>,<br />
measured in Rust Watt Minutes (rWm).</p>
<p>Contrarily, in a Capacitor, we gauge the power storage by examining
an Input/Output (IO) connection and observing a figure that is typically
associated with <code>power</code> or the amount of power available for
use.<br />
But within the Capacitor, this figure <strong>DOES NOT indicate the
amount of power that can be utilized</strong>. Rather, this figure is
what we call <code>Wire Capacity</code>, symbolized as <code>Np</code>.
For instance, in the image below, the displayed <code>6,492,076</code>
is <strong>NOT</strong> the amount of power available. Instead, it
represents <code>6,492,076Np</code> of Wire Capacity.</p>
<p>Before going into the construction and operation of a Capacitor, it’s
essential to understand the math conversions between Rust Watt Minutes
(rWm) and Wire Capacity (Np).</p>
<p>Both represent capacity, but they use different units of measurement
depending on the energy storage container, be it a battery or a
capacitor.</p>
<p>The Maths :<br />
<code>rWm</code>: rust watt minute<br />
<code>rW</code>: rust watts (commonly referred to as “power”)<br />
<code>Np</code>: Wire Capacity<br />
<code>∅</code>: 7.5 (Trust Me Bro)<br />
<code>S</code>: Seconds<br />
<code>τ</code>: 60 (The number of seconds in a minute)<br />
<code>M</code>: Minutes<br />
<code>P</code>: Max power output for 1 second<br />
<code>O</code>: The amount of power you want to output<br />
<code>H</code>: Hours</p>
<p>To convert rWm into Wire Capacity(Np) we use the following
equation:<br />
<code>(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np</code></p>
<p>To convert Wire Capacity(Np) into rWm we use the following
equation:<br />
<code>(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm</code></p>
<p>To figure out how much time a given capacity will run for outputting
a specific amount of power, we use the following equations:<br />
<code>Seconds: (rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>Minutes: rWm ÷ O = M</code><br />
<code>Hours: (rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H</code></p>
<p>Examples Using Capacity from the battery in the first picture, we can
figure out the number we would see if we were looking at an IO
connection in a Capacitor to view Wire Capacity(Np).<br />
<code>(rWm × τ = P) × ∅ = Np</code><br />
<code>(271 × 60 = 16,260) × 7.5 = 121,950Np</code></p>
<p>Therefore a capacity of 271rWm when viewed on an IO connection is
equal to 121,950Np. We can also see that if the Large Battery did not
have an output limit of 100, it would be able to output 16,260 power for
1 second.</p>
<p>Using the IO connection to view Wire Capacity(Np) from the second
picture, we can figure out how much rWm of Capacity we would have if
this was viewed on a battery.<br />
<code>(Np ÷ ∅ = P) ÷ τ = rWm</code><br />
<code>(6,492,076 ÷ 7.5 = 865,610.1333) ÷ 60 = 14,426rWm</code></p>
<p>Therefore a Wire Capacity of 6,492,076Np when viewed on a battery
represented as Capacity, it is equal to 14,426rWm.<br />
Without a limited output, the Capacitor is capable of delivering 865,610
power for 1 second.</p>
<p>Using both of these examples, we can calculate the length of time
both the Battery and Capacitor would power a circuit for, given a set
output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our example, let’s say the circuit needs 100 power.</p>
<p>Battery :<br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>(271÷ 100 = 2.71 Minutes) × 60 = 162 Seconds</code></p>
<p>Capacitor : <em>(you will need to convert from Np to rWm
first)</em><br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) × τ = S</code><br />
<code>(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) × 60 = 8,655 Seconds</code></p>
<p>OR :<br />
<code>(rWm ÷ O = M) ÷ τ = H</code><br />
<code>(14,426 ÷ 100 = 144.26 Minutes) ÷ 60 = 2.40 Hours</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to constructing a capacitor, it’s crucial to understand its
limitations and potential issues. This will clarify misconceptions such
as the notion of ‘infinite power’ and help identify the appropriate
contexts for its use.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t survive server restarts. everytime the server restarts,
all of the stored power will vanish, poof gone.<br />
</li>
<li>When automating energy extraction, it is possible that a flicker
will be created or worse, all the power vanishes, poof gone.</li>
<li>It consumes power even when nothing is connected to it, unlike a
battery that doesn’t lose power if nothing is connected to it.</li>
<li>It is not portable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some of the advantages and benefits of the Capacitor</p>

<ul>
<li>There are 2 modes, Peacekeeper and Attack All.</li>
<li>You can enable and disable Peacekeeper mode by looking at the turret
and pressing and holding E. In peace keeper mode it will only attack
someone if they become aggressive. In Attack All mode it will kill
anyone not on its authorization list.</li>
<li>1rW will pulse out of Has Target if it takes damage and will release
a constant 1rW if it locks a target.</li>
<li>Low Ammo will start to output 1rW when there is 50 ammo or less.
When it has no more ammo it will stop outputting power.</li>
<li>No ammo will output 1rW constantly when there is no more ammo.</li>
<li>Range is 30 meters or 10 square foundations</li>
<li>Must be placed on flat surfaces</li>
<li>Try to place them in a way they cannot be baited to be drained</li>
<li>They contain their own authorization list</li>
<li>The turret has just over a 180 degree detection arch</li>
<li>They can shoot through 2 layers of Chainlink Fence.</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla Coil damage is the amount of input power per second up to a
max of 35. This means if you give a tesla coil 5rW, it will do 5 damage
per second. Give it 35rW and it will do 35 damage a second.</li>
<li>Their damage is stackable. 100 Tesla Coils given 1rW will kill a
person in 1 second.</li>
<li>The range is just over 1 foundation or 3.5 meters</li>
<li>Can be placed on all surfaces including the ground</li>
<li>With a building trick, a tesla coil can zap people through walls,
floors and roofs.</li>
<li>They damage themselves at a rate of 2hp/sec</li>
<li>They will not turn on if their health is at or below 62</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change strobe settings. Look at the
light and hold USE(E) to change the frequency of the strobe between
10hz, 20hz and 40hz or to manually turn it on.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the light. For example, if you send constant power
to TURN ON, the light turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the light
will turn off. When you remove power from TURN OFF, the light will not
turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. You will need to
remove and reapply power to TURN ON for the light to turn back on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the light on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If you apply power to TOGGLE, the light will turn on. While the
light is on, if you send power to TURN OFF, the light will turn off.
When you remove power from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE,
the light will not turn back on. On the other hand if you send power to
TURN ON, the light will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the light
will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, we remove power from
TOGGLE and the light will turn off. This is because when you remove
power from TOGGLE, it tells the light to turn off.</li>
<li>They take damage when active at a rate of 1hp/3min42sec</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the
ground</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp</li>

<li>This item can only be crafted if you have the item in your Steam
Inventory. It must be purchased from the community market</li>
<li>When Active, it creates a fog cloud in front of it that covers an
area equal to a 2x2 and is thickest below half height walls. Consumes
low grade fuel at 1 per minute.</li>
<li>When set to Motion, it only gets set off by non authorized players
and will emit fog every couple seconds creating a thicker cloud directly
in front of it. Setting the fogger at a half wall height, the constant
emission of the fogger creates a thick cloud at eye level. Consumes low
grade fuel at 10 per minute.</li>
<li>The fogger only emits a cloud as long as the non authorized player
is moving. If the player stops moving, the fogger turns off.</li>
<li>A cloud takes 5 seconds to form and 40 seconds to disappear.</li>
<li>Increasing the number of foggers increases the density of the cloud.
4 foggers is enough to block the light from fire and 5 will block light
from electrical lighting.</li>
<li>Fog will fall toward the ground and accumulate on any horizontal
surface. The higher the fogger the thinner the cloud.</li>
<li>Requires TC authorization to change settings. Look at the light and
hold USE(E) to Activate, Open or turn on Motion.</li>
<li>Whichever input is the last to be activated is the input that
dictates the state of the fogger. For example, if you send constant
power to TURN ON, the fogger turns on. Then send power to TURN OFF, the
fogger will turn off. When you remove power from TURN OFF, the fogger
will not turn back on even with power still going to TURN ON. You will
need to remove and reapply power to TURN ON for the fogger to turn back
on.</li>
<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the fogger on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. This does not change the previous bullet
point. If you apply power to TOGGLE, the fogger will turn on. While the
fogger is on, if you send power to TURN OFF, the fogger will turn off.
When you remove power from TURN OFF with power still going to TOGGLE,
the fogger will not turn back on. On the other hand if you send power to
TURN ON, the fogger will turn on. Then send power to TOGGLE and the
fogger will stay on. With power still going to TURN ON, we remove power
from TOGGLE and the fogger will turn off. This is because when you
remove power from TOGGLE, it tells the fogger to turn off.</li>
<li>They can be placed on flat and angled surfaces as well as the
ground</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer but loses 10hp</li>

<li>The TOGGLE input will turn the machine on when it receives power and
turn off when power is removed. When TURN ON receives power, the machine
will turn on and stay on when TURN ON loses power. When TURN OFF
receives power, it will always turn the machine off. If power is
currently going to TURN OFF, sending power to the other inputs will turn
the machine on.</li>

<li>The Reset input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Inverted Output</li>
<li>The Set input will cause the Memory Cell to send power through
Output</li>
<li>The Toggle input will cause the Memory Cell to switch the output
which power is going through</li>
<li>The side inputs are prioritized from top to bottom. This means if
power is applied to Set when power is applied to Reset or Toggle,
nothing will happen. If power is applied to Reset when power is applied
to Toggle, nothing will happen, but, if power is applied to Set, it will
override Reset and force the Memory Cell to send power through
Output</li>
<li>When switching from one output to the other, power will pass through
the new output first before removing power from the old output</li>
<li>The 2 outputs are currently bugged. When you try to see the power
info by pointing at the outputs with a Wire Tool, it will show the
incoming power being evenly split between both outputs. This is a visual
bug. 100% of the power is only coming out of 1 of the outputs</li>

<ul>
<li>Holding ‘E’ with a wire tool will let you configure the counter. The
options are Set Target and Show Passthrough</li>
<li>Set Target lets you pick a number between 1 and 100. When the
counter is equal to the target number, or greater, the counter will pass
power through</li>
<li>Show Passthrough will show the amount of incoming power.</li>
<li>When power is applied to Increment Counter, the Counter will count
up by 1</li>
<li>When power is applied to Decrement Counter, the Counter will count
down by 1</li>
<li>When power is applied to Clear Counter, the Counter will reset back
to 0</li>
<li>The Counter does not need power to count up, down or be cleared</li>
<li>When set to Show Passthrough, if it only shows 1, connect the
Passthrough (output) to any input on any component. This will cause the
counter to actually pass power through so it can show the amount.</li>
<li>Using a Counter on the floor on its thin side, within a 1 meter
radius, if an item like a furnace or sleeping bag is removed, the
Counter will also disappear. When placing or removing building
structures, the Counter will also disappear.</li>
<li>The following items can be placed on top of a counter that is placed
down on its thin side: Lantern, Jackolanterns, carvable pumpkins,
sandbag and concrete barricades, pookie bear, twitch trophy, eggs and
the small candle. Placing multiple counters together to create a larger
pad, you can put larger things like a small battery on top.</li>

<li>When a switch is off, it will block all the components past it from
registering active usage on batteries</li>
<li>Can only be placed on vertical surfaces</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="side-inputs"><a href="#side-inputs"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Side Inputs</h2>
<p>They are not bugged or broken, you just don’t know how to use them
yet.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for people to think of ‘Switch On’ and ‘Switch
Off’ as a toggle like on the side of a Timer. They are not toggles, they
are inputs with an added function. Just like the ‘Power In’ on the
bottom, the side inputs also pass power through to the top. The function
part only functions when power is received, removed or the amount of
power is updated.</p>
<p>When ANY input on the Switch receives an “update”, the Switch will
bind to that input for its source of power that passes through to the
top. It will remain bound to that input until another input “updates”
which will force the switch to bind to the new input. An update is
either losing power or receiving power, 0-1 or 1-0 or power levels
change up or down.</p>
<p>The exception to this is when one input is receiving an amount of
power and another input receives the same amount of power, the Switch
will not recognize the new source and remain bound to the original
input.</p>
<p>The following pictures will help illustrate how it works.</p>
<p>Starting off, we are using 3 Switches to provide 3 different amounts
of power each input. Green wire is for Switch On. Red wire is for Switch
Off. Black wire is for Electric Input on the bottom. Yellow lines mark
the path power is taking. Red lines mark where power stops. In this
first picture, we are sending power to the bottom input and the Switch
sends it out the top, with the expected power loss.</p>
<p>Next, we leave power going into the bottom and then apply power to
Switch Off. As we can see, the Switch will flip off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image41.png" /></p>
<p><img src="images/image13.png" /></p>
<p>If we manually flip the Switch back on, we can now see a new amount
of power displaying on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image75.png" /></p>
<p>This is because the Switch is now bound to the Switch Off input for
the power that passes through to the top. The power going into the
bottom input is completely ignored. For the next picture, we flip the
Switch back off and then apply power to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image64.png" /></p>
<p>The Switch will now flip on and once again pass through a new amount
of power to the counter. The power going to the bottom input or Switch
Off input is now ignored and the Switch is bound to Switch On. In the
next picture, we remove power from Switch On while keeping power applied
to Switch Off and the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="images/image30.png" /></p>
<p>We can see here now that power was removed from Switch On, the Switch
has no power. The green light turns off and the Switch is still in the
on position. Even though the other 2 inputs have power, the Switch is
bound to Switch On for its source of power, which was removed. If we
restore power to Switch On, the Switch will start passing power though
again like the previous picture. With power restored, for the next
picture we will remove power from Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image44.png" /></p>
<p>We restored power to Switch On before removing power from Switch Off.
The green light turns off when power is removed and the Switch binds to
the Switch Off. This is because that input received an update from
‘having power’ to ‘not having power’, from 1 to 0. For the next picture,
we restore power to Switch Off.</p>
<p><img src="images/image53.png" /></p>
<p>Restoring power to the Switch Off input, the red light turns on and
the Switch flips to the off position. When we manually flip it on we can
see the new amount of power passing through.</p>
<p><img src="images/image105.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing that we only have 28 power showing on the counter, it is clear
power is coming through the Switch Off input. When we remove power from
the bottom input, the Switch loses power.</p>
<p><img src="images/image73.png" /></p>
<p>It loses power because the bottom input was updated, from 1 to 0, so
the Switch bound to it. Now bound to the bottom input and not receiving
power, the green light turns off and no power passes through. Restoring
power to the bottom input, the green light turns back on and the new
power amount is displayed on the counter.</p>
<p><img src="images/image126.png" /></p>
<p>Seeing the power level on the counter confirming power is coming into
the bottom, we will now adjust the Electrical Branch to send more power
to Switch On.</p>
<p><img src="images/image116.png" /></p>
<p>After increasing the amount of power, we can see an instant change on
the counter to reflect that the Switch changed the input it was bound to
from the bottom input to Switch On.</p>
<p>In conclusion, whichever is the last input to receive an update is
the input the Switch will bind to for its source of power. Adding power,
removing power or a change in power levels will update the Switches
input. When moving power from one input to another, it is important</p>

<li>To use it in delay mode, just throw the explosive charge with a left
click. It will beep for 10 seconds before exploding. The red light will
be on.</li>
<li>To use in RF mode, enter your inventory and select the charge. Click
on ‘Enable RF’ then ‘Set Frequency’. Use left click to throw the
explosive charge onto something you want to destroy and wait 10 seconds
for the beeping to stop. The green light will be on. Set a RF
Broadcaster or RF Transmitter to the same frequency and transmit when
you want the charge to detonate.</li>
<li>Due to the introduction of RF mode, RF Broadcasters and Transmitters
now take 0.5 damage when changing frequencies.</li>
<li>Anyone can pick up the charge after the beeping stops by looking at
it and holding USE(E)</li>

and hold USE(E). You can access Radio Settings or Open. Open allows you
to insert a cassette. Radio Settings lets you select a Radio
Station.</li>
<li>The Audio Out connection lets you send an audio signal to other
components in the DLC that can interact with sound.</li>
<li>Can be picked up with a hammer, but not with a cassette. Will not
take damage when picked up.</li>
<li>Can be placed in horizontal surfaces, the ground and some deployable
items like Work Benches and Tables.</li>
<li>They block the destruction detectors ability to see downstream</li>
<li>An Electrical Branch set to 10 will show an Active Usage of 10 on a
battery. If we use the 10 from Branch Out to power a Boom Box, the
battery will continue to show an Active Usage of 10. If we then make a
connection between Power Out on the Electrical Branch and Toggle Play on
the Boom Box, the battery will now register an Active Usage of 20. This
only appears to happen with the Electrical Branch, 10 for the Branch and
10 for the Boom Box Toggle. If you replace it with a Splitter, the
battery will only register 11 Active Usage, 10 for the Boom Box and 1
for the Splitter. <img src="images/image90.jpg" /></li>

<p>It is a system that lets you collect, store, transport and distribute
water in game. It functions similarly to the electrical system in that
it has its own hand tool and you connect components in the same way.</p>
<p>Its primary use is for farming plants like hemp, berries and other
foods.</p>
<p>Gravity is something you will need to be aware of. When sending water
down towards the ground, gravity will assist you. If at any point you
need to route water up away from the ground, you will require a
component that can pump and that component will need electricity to
function.</p>

<h1 id="the-structure-of-a-base-circuit"><a
href="#the-structure-of-a-base-circuit" class="anchor-link">*</a>The
Structure of a Base Circuit</h1>
<p>All circuits for a base follow the same basic structure.<br />
It doesn’t matter if the base has 1 circuit or more, they all contain 4
main parts with an optional 5th part that does not have a static
location.<br />
We have the Power Source, Battery Backup, Distribution, End
Devices/Circuits and the 5th, Destruction Detection.<br />
Using the following flow chart we can help illustrate this.</p>
<p><img src="images/image38.png" /></p>
<p>Moving top to bottom, every circuit needs a power source. You have 3
choices, Windmills, Solar Panels or Small Generators.</p>
<p>We then take our source power and feed it to a Battery Backup. You
have 2 choices, the Inline or Bypass(Nih Core). Either way, you must
ensure you are supplying enough power to keep your batteries
charged.</p>
<p>From the battery backup, we will then need to distribute the power to
the different systems in the base. There are 3 options, a Fixed or
Dynamic Bus or a Configure Siphon.</p>
<p>If you are working with Inline Battery Backup, you want to minimize a
battery’s Active Usage. If you are working with a Bypass Battery Backup,
you want to maximize the use of Consumable Power.</p>
<p>The End Devices and Circuits are your turrets, lights, cameras,
farms, sensor grids, ect. The Destruction Detection system should be
included in most circuits and if limited to one, placing one after the
battery backup is probably the best option.</p>

<h1 id="battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"><a
href="#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Battery Active Usage Vs Actual Power
Consumed</h1>
<p>Simply put, active usage is what a battery uses to calculate its
charge and discharge rate. Power consumed is the amount of power a
component requires to operate. Active Usage doesn’t always = Power
Consumed. This is also where the argument of Electrical Branch vs
Splitter comes from. Once you understand this section, you will know the
answer to this age-old argument.</p>
<p>When you look at the battery with a wire tool, you will see Active
Usage. Active Usage is the amount of power the battery is draining by.
This is the number you want to use when calculating how much power to
give a battery for it to remain charged based on the battery’s 80%
efficiency. Active Usage divided by 0.8 = a battery’s minimum power
input. <img src="images/large-battery-ui.png" /></p>
<p>It is reasonable to think that the number you see is the amount of
power your circuit is currently consuming, but it’s not always the case.
Even when some components are turned off and not consuming power, they
can still add to a battery’s Active Usage. In this next picture, even
though the Auto Turret is not consuming power, it is still adding to the
battery’s</p>
<p><img src="images/turned-off-usage.png" /></p>
<p>Active Usage and in fact, it will actually consume 14 power. In this
case even though the AND Switch is not allowing power to pass through,
it does not have the ability to hide the Active Usage from inactive
components downstream or past it. In this next picture, if we use
different components to achieve the same outcome, we can hide</p>
<p><img src="images/hide-active-usage.png" /></p>
<p>the Auto Turret’s Active Usage from the battery when it is not
consuming power. This setup reduces the Active Usage all the way to 6.
When active, we will get an Active Usage of 16 but it will actually
consume 18.<br />
Components like Switches, the Blocker, Timer and RF Transmitter all have
the ability to hide a component’s Active Usage from batteries when not
passing power through.</p>
<p>Every component will only register an Active Usage once and equal to
the amount of power it consumes with the exception of the Electrical
Branch. Only the Branch Out value will register Active Usage even though
it does consume 1 power for itself. An Electrical Branch set to 2 will
register an Active Usage of 2 but will consume 3. Branch Out is a FIXED
value. The thing to remember is that it is the Branch Out value that is
registering Active Usage, not the components connected to Branch Out.
This means that the components connected to Branch Out, even though it
is where they are getting their power from, their Active Usage is not
what is registering on the battery. If there is another path that lets
the battery see these components, it is possible for their Active Usage
to register on the battery along with the Branch Out value, effectively
doubling the power needed. This next picture is a quick example to show
how a Boom Box that is powered from Branch Out, but using a Switch to
Toggle Play on and off, is registering 10 Active Usage for the Branch
Out, 1 for the Switch and 10 for the Boom Box. If we do the same thing,
but with the Splitter, we dont have this issue because the Splitter
controls its power flow DYNAMICALLY. <img
src="images/branch-vs-splitter-active-usage-onoff.png" /></p>
<p>This is helpful in situations where you have a few small circuits
where you dont want to force an Active Usage when the circuits are off.
Now because the Electrical Branch only registers the Branch Out value as
Active Usage and 0 for itself, we can trick batteries into thinking less
power is being consumed. In the next picture, we have some examples
using Auto Turrets. <img
src="images/active-usage-vs-pwr-consuption-turret.png" /></p>
<p>Above, we have 1 example using 8 Electrical Branches to power 9 Auto
Turrets. Every branch is outputting 10 power but also consuming 1 power
for itself. So in total we are consuming 98 power but the battery’s
Active Usage is only 90. The 2nd example we are using 4 Splitters to
power the same number of turrets only this time the Splitters are
consuming 1 and have an Active Usage of 1 each. This gives us an Active
Usage and Power Consumption of 94. The example with Electrical Branches
only has 2 extra power meaning there is enough power available to add a
single Ceiling Light while the 2nd example has 6 extra power, that’s
enough power for 3 Ceiling Lights.</p>
<p>In the situation where an Inline Battery is being used, you want to
minimize the battery’s Active Usage to minimize the cost of power
production. Like in the single Auto Turret examples above, there is a
required input power difference of 9rW just to maintain the battery.
Batteries are 80% efficient. Take the Active Usage number and divide it
by 0.8. This will give you the minimum amount of power required to
maintain the battery and it will not drain. It wont charge either. The
more power above the minimum, the faster the battery will charge but the
more you will waste when the battery is full. 1rW will charge a large
battery but it will take 34 IRL days.</p>
<p>In a bypass system like the Nih Core, Active Usage doesn’t matter
because you are not relying on the battery as a main power source. You
are bypassing the battery. This means that the amount of power consumed
is more important. If we look at the above picture again with the 9 Auto
Turrets, we can see that while both examples are accomplishing the same
goal, 1 is consuming less power then the other. If we look back at the
single Auto Turret examples, the 1st example with an Active Usage of 13
will actually consume 14 vs the 2nd with an Active Usage of 6 will
actually consume 18. So while the 1st example is bad on an Inline
system, it is better in a bypass system. The less power you can use to
do something, gives you more power to do other things.</p>
<p>You can use a bypass system with 1 Large Battery and only use 50
power to double the life of the battery but, it is more common to see a
bypass system used for 2 or more batteries to get a larger output. If we
are using 2 or more batteries to get the higher output, a Root Combiner
will be used. The moment we combine batteries to power a circuit that
uses more than 100 power, both batteries will have an Active Usage of
100. This is because load sharing is not a thing in Rustricity. If the
circuit only needs 50, both batteries will have an Active Usage of
50(plus 1 for the Root Combiner).</p>
<p><img src="images/root-combined-batterys.png" /></p>
<p>Due to this being the way it is, if you combine 2 batteries to get
200 power, try to use all 200 because no matter if the circuit needs 101
or 199, 2 large batteries will only last 4 hours. If they are only going
to last 4 hours regardless, try to use as much of that 200 as possible
to make it worth combining the batteries. Otherwise, split the circuit,
run Inlines and minimize the Active Usage.</p>
<p>Now, having said you want to consume as little power as possible to
achieve the desired outcome when using a bypass battery backup, there
are times when it is worth consuming more for a bit of added security.
In the next picture, Ive used medium batteries for the demonstration,
and they are root combined powering some Auto Turrets.</p>
<p><img src="images/power-bus-security-compared-turrets.png" /></p>
<p>The top groups are using Electrical Branches. They are consuming more
power but in the event 1 battery is destroyed, top right, some turrets
stay active. The bottom groups use Splitters. While they do consume less
power, in the event a battery is lost, very bottom, all the turrets go
offline. You will need to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is
right to fit your needs. Read more in What is a Power Bus?</p>

<h1 id="short-circuit-max-depth"><a href="#short-circuit-max-depth"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit / Max Depth</h1>
<p>This is a single message that is displayed for 2 different errors. At
the time of creating this section, XOR Switches did not consume any
power which is why you will see them used in the pictures. The pictures
might get remade in time but power consumption is not important when
discussing and understanding this error.</p>
<h2 id="short-circuit"><a href="#short-circuit"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Short Circuit</h2>
<p>A short circuit happens when you have power feeding back into itself,
AKA, a loop.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image124.png" /></p>
<p>Why would you do this? You wouldn’t. In the past, batteries
functioned differently and there was a need to create the “Infinite
Power Loop”. Today, batteries have something called “Active Usage”. This
breaks the infinite loop and eliminates a need for it to exist.</p>
<p>You can circumvent a short circuit by increasing the number of
components in the loop to be 9 or greater.</p>
<p><img src="images/image10.png" /></p>
<p>In the next picture we show a battery feeding power back into
itself.</p>
<p><img src="images/image62.png" /></p>
<p>There is no reason to do this anymore. There was a time when
batteries could only exist in 1 state at a time. They were either
charging or discharging and when they were discharging, they were always
doing it at their max. Back then, people found a way to use the extra
power and send it back to the battery. For example, a large battery was
always outputting 100 power whereas today, they calculate an active
usage and only drain the amount of power a circuit needs, up to 100.
Today, if the circuit only needs 50, the battery only gives 50.</p>
<p>The other thing to note is batteries also cause an active usage. For
a large battery, it is 400, so in the above loop, you are forcing a max
drain on the battery. There is no advantage to this.</p>
<h2 id="max-depth"><a href="#max-depth" class="anchor-link">*</a>Max
Depth</h2>
<p>Maximum Depth is referring to the number of components between your
power source and the  Root Combiner. A Max Depth error will occur when
we exceed 16 components.</p>
<p><img src="images/image101.png" /></p>
<p>It is important to understand this mechanic and how to calculate it.
This becomes important when combining multiple power sources including a
battery backup with multiple combined batteries. If you experience this
error, to calculate the depth of a circuit, we start with the last Root
Combiner or the combiner that is furthest away from the power source and
count the number of components power must pass through all the way back
to the power source. This limits where in a circuit you can use Root
Combiners.</p>
<p>The below images are 2 ways root combiners can be stacked. The group
on the left is known as pyramid stacking and the group on the right is
known as a daisy chain. While both groups are possible, you can see that
the group on the left is only 4 components deep whereas the right side
is 8 deep. This is important when working with a large amount of
centralized power because you can quickly use up the depth and then not
be able to have the number of batteries you want or need.</p>
<p><img src="images/image7.png" /></p>
<p>In this next image, we have 8 Windmills combined into a Nih Core with
a battery backup containing 6 Large Batteries. This circuit has a total
depth of 13 components. The trick to counting depth is counting the
components in the longest route from the last Root Combiner, #1 back to
the Windmill, #13.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image99.png" /></p>
<p>In the next example, we have 2 isolated power sources. The first
source is the cluster of Windmills. The second is the combined Solar
Panels for the Component Destruction Detector. This means that we have 2
paths we must consider when calculating the depth. The first path to
look at is the one that goes from the Root Combiner #1 back to the
Windmill #14. This path is the main power path. The second path goes
from Root Combiner #1 back to the Solar Panel #16. If one of these paths
exceed the Max Depth limit of 16 components, you will start to see the
error message at Root Combiner #1.</p>
<p><img src="images/image50.png" /></p>
<p>The next image shows a Max Depth using an equal number of Windmills
and Batteries with a Nih Core.</p>

<h1 id="circuit-delay-and-power-flow"><a
href="#circuit-delay-and-power-flow" class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuit
Delay and Power Flow</h1>
<p>NEEDS WORK</p>
<p>A simple explanation for now:</p>
<p>Circuit Delay at its most basic is the amount of time it takes power
to pass from one component to another. The reason there is circuit delay
is because we are dealing with lines of code. Specifically we are
dealing with lines of code for electricity in Rust, aka rustricity.
Rustricity is a single threaded system. This means that everything
happens 1 line of code at a time for the entire server. It doesn’t
matter how many circuits are running on a server at 1 time. The server
will process everything rustricity, every  activation, deactivation,
action, reaction, transfer etcetera, 1 at a time. Now this doesn’t need
to be said but just to make sure we are all on the same page, the server
you login to to play on is running or hosted on a computer. That
computer is also referred to as a server. The faster the hardware of
this server is and the more dedicated this hardware is to running the
game server, the better rustricity will perform.</p>
<p>The best rustricity will perform on any server is when it is solely
hosting a vanilla game. The more programs running on the server or the
more plugins installed for the game, the slower the rustricity will
function therefore increasing circuit delay. The amount of time we are
talking about is incredibly small but a lot of small increases will
eventually become a large amount of time. One way to test how fast
rustricity is on any server is by stringing a bunch of lights together,
the more the better, and watch how long it takes for all of them to turn
on and off.</p>
<p>Power Flow is the path electricity takes through a circuit. Using the
picture below to help illustrate, when we flip the</p>
<p><img src="images/passtrough-chain.png" /></p>
<p>Switch on, light 1 will power on followed by light 2 then light 3 and
finally light 4. When we flip the Switch off, light 1 will power off
followed by light 2 then light 3 and finally light 4. Power flow gets a
little more complicated when we introduce components with multiple
outputs. Starting with the Electrical Branch that has 2 outputs, power
is first sent</p>
<p><img src="images/branch-outputs.png" /></p>
<p>through Power Out then power gets sent through Branch Out. When it is
removed, it will first be removed from Power Out then Branch Out.</p>
<p>The Splitter is similar but it has 3 outputs.</p>
<p><img src="images/splitter-out.png" /></p>
<p>Power first goes through Power Out 1 followed by Power Out 2 then
Power Out 3. When power is removed, it will be removed first from Power
Out 1 followed by Power Out 2 then Power Out 3. On the small scale, this
is easy to follow but as we start to build larger circuits it can be a
little more complicated but is absolutely crucial to understand when you
start integrating logic or having multiple circuits interacting with
each other.</p>
<p>Lets dive a little deeper into this concept by analyzing the Nih
Core.</p>

<h1 id="centralized-vs-decentralized"><a
href="#centralized-vs-decentralized"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized vs Decentralized</h1>
<h1 id="locations"><a href="#locations"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Locations</h1>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing electricity, we are
talking about 1 of 2 things. We are either talking about the physical
placement of components or we are talking about power flow from a source
to the end component. In a 100% completely centralized system, the
electrical circuit would collect, store and distribute power all through
a single circuit and all of this would be located in a single electrical
room/area. A 100% completely decentralized system would have independent
circuits with their own power source, battery backup, and distribution
located in different rooms/areas for each system and section of a base.
These 2 concepts exist on the extreme ends of a spectrum. The best
circuit does not need to be one or the other, it can be located anywhere
in between. There are several variables including the server, wipe
length, group size, the base, server limits and electrical experience
that will influence the solution that works for your situation. This is
not a 1 size fits all. The best circuit is the one that does the job you
need in the time you need it.</p>
<p>First we will talk about the physical placement then we will get into
the electrical circuit(s).</p>
<p>When talking about centralizing or decentralizing the physical
location of components, it should be understood that we are NOT talking
about the auto turrets on the roof for defense. We are NOT talking about
the quality of life improvements of having electric heaters everywhere
because the build location was in the arctic biome. We are NOT talking
about the components placed on walls for the purpose of destruction
detection. What we are talking about is the location of the core
components. We are talking about all the circuits that power, control
and support the defensive systems, monitoring systems or quality of life
systems. We are talking about the location of collection points for
power sources, battery backups, the batteries, power buses and all the
logic circuits for everything electric in a base. We are talking about
the location a Windmill sends its power to or the place where the wire
that powers the auto turret comes from.  </p>
<h2 id="centralized-location"><a href="#centralized-location"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Location</h2>
<p><img src="images/image37.png" /></p>
<p>Where you place these components is very important because you don’t
want to make it easy for raiders to destroy them. You want to protect
your circuits like you protect your TC. Centralizing the placement of
these components in a single room or area is very convenient. It’s easy
to add layers of honeycomb, add lots of traps and doors to protect but
can come at the potential risk that if raiders get into this room/area,
with 1 rocket they can destroy and disable everything. You could place
it in a spot where raiders would not think to or want to raid. When
centralizing, the location should not be an afterthought. It should be
preplanned into the base.</p>
<p>No matter where the room is, hiding the wires that will need to lead
to and from this room is a must. They should be either hidden out of
sight or mislead the raiders as to the rooms location. Wires are limited
in length so in smaller bases, it is much easier to reach all the
components outside the room, like auto turrets, without requiring extra
components to extend the wire. In larger bases, this can become a
problem if you don’t have a safe place to put components to extend the
wires. A safe place should not be easier to destroy than the end
component itself. As an example, if you are using a memory cell to
extend a wire to an auto turret. The memory cell should not be easier to
destroy than the auto turret it connects to. When it comes to wire
extensions, any component with a passthrough works but IMO, Industrial
Lights are the best because they are cheap to craft and easy to make
look like it is just base lighting giving it the perfect camouflage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decentralized-locations"><a href="#decentralized-locations"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Locations</h2>
<p><img src="images/image107.jpg" /></p>
<p>Decentralizing the physical locations of circuits is where there are
2 or more electrical rooms/areas. These locations should be hard to find
and harder to raid. These locations should be rooms that raiders would
not think is worth raiding. The more rooms there are, the less likely
raiders will disable every system when cutting the base in half with
rockets. The larger the base is, the easier it should be spreading out
the electrical rooms/areas. The more spread out these locations are the
more protected they are and has the added benefit of not needing wire
extensions to reach end devices in a given area.</p>
<p>Hiding your wires is very important. Any information a raider can
collect about the locations of your electrical rooms should be
minimized. With the limitation of wire length, decentralizing can be an
excellent way of distributing power closer to where it is actually
needed. Eliminating the need to use wire extensions makes things more
secure and builders won’t need to build in extra rooms just for this.
These locations could be anywhere but it is recommended you plan them
into the build for more security. Electrical rooms should not be an
afterthought just like the disconnected TC was not an afterthought.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="circuits"><a href="#circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Circuits</h1>
<p>When we talk about centralizing or decentralizing circuits, we are
talking about how we are delivering power from the source to the
different systems and end components. It is crucial to understand the
structure of a base circuit because it makes it easier to visualize the
difference between Centralized and Decentralized circuits. To help
explain this, we will use 3 different end devices/circuits. First - Auto
Turrets, Second - A HBHF grid to know where enemies are and Third -
Lights.</p>
<p>Centralized is a single system with all power sources, destruction
detection, batteries, power distribution and end systems connected in a
single circuit. To be more specific, all power sources get combined and
run through a destruction detector into a battery backup system. From
the battery back up we provide all of the end devices and circuits with
a single distribution system.</p>
<p><img src="images/image70.png" /></p>
<p>Decentralized is when we provide all of our end systems with their
own power source, destruction detection(optional), battery and power
distribution. Decentralization is a concept that exists on a spectrum.
On one extreme it could be as simple as cutting the base in half and
using 1 circuit for the North and 1 for the South or putting the turrets
on 1 circuit and keeping the HBHF and lights on another. On the other
extreme end we break every end system down as far as we want. Let’s
start with auto turrets and let’s say we have 15 of them. 3 per side,
North, South, East and West as well as 3 on the roof. That could be 5
separate circuits. 5 separate power sources with 5 different detectors,
5 battery backups and 5 separate distributors. Then we could also do the
same with the HBHF grind. Separate that into 5 circuits. Destruction
detection could be included in all of those circuits and separate stand
alone systems could be added for all the walls on each of the 4 sides.
Even the lights if you wanted to could be decentralized.  </p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" /></p>
<p>Knowing ahead of time what systems your base will use, how much power
they consume, the size of the base and the environment being played in
(competitive vs casual), will influence your design. For best results,
design the base build around your circuits so you never need to
sacrifice functionality or security.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="centralized-circuits"><a href="#centralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Centralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Here we can look at some examples of a centralized circuit. Like we
stated before, the idea is to combine everything into a single circuit.
These have the advantage of being less complex but at the disadvantage
of having single points of failure. The first circuit we can look at in
the image below is pretty simple. We have a single source of power
feeding an inline battery backup supplying power to our end components
and circuits through a single distributor. We are starting with an
inline backup because it does not scale efficiently in a centralized
environment and it is easier to see points of failure. If the battery
gets destroyed or if the first Electrical Branch gets taken out, the
entire system goes offline.</p>
<p><img src="images/image65.png" /></p>
<p>The trick with an Inline system is to produce enough power to keep
your battery charged but not produce so much that power is wasted. A
large battery needs a constant input of 125 to not drain if its Active
Usage is maxed out at 100. With an input of 127, it will take that
battery 34 days to fully charge from empty. Always try to precharge the
batteries above 3,000rWm before letting them power the circuit. Anything
above what’s needed to maintain the battery will be a waste of power
when the battery is full.</p>
<p>When a circuit requires more than 100 power, and the goal is still to
centralize, switch to a bypass system like the Nih Core and max out your
batteries potential. If the amount of reliable power that can be
produced is limited, the goal should be to minimize the battery’s Active
Usage to a state that is manageable. The lower it is, the less power
needed to maintain the battery and the longer it will last when main
power is gone. Refer to the section titled Battery Active Usage Vs
Actual Power Consumed for a better understanding of the 2 game
mechanics.</p>
<p>This next example uses the same end systems but has multiple power
sources and multiple batteries to support the same or more components.
It uses the Nih Core bypass battery backup and provides power to all the
different end systems through a single distributor. The number of end
systems you want to run and the amount of power they will consume will
dictate how much power you need to generate and the number of batteries
you need to support everything in the event of a power outage. If your
circuit needs 160rW, we will use 2 large batteries. If we need 470rw, we
will use 5 large batteries. DO NOT mix and match battery sizes.</p>
<p> <img src="images/image12.png" /></p>
<p>Before it was said that the above example could support the same or
more components. The Nih Core really is meant to scale up to larger
power demands but let’s say the demand is only 100, that means we have
built in some redundancy. 1 turbine or battery could be destroyed and
the circuit would still function as normal. This is an expensive way of
having redundancy but it does work. This is meant to be easily scalable
to any size power load but once we start to root combine batteries, we
should try to maximize the combined batteries potential by consuming as
much as possible. This means that if we have 2 large batteries, we
should try to use as much of the 200rW as possible. When batteries get
root combined, they do not share the load as one would expect.</p>
<p>For example, we have a circuit with 2 large batteries supporting a
load of 50. It would seem to make sense that 50 power divided by 2
batteries equals 25 per battery, but rustricity doesn’t work like that.
That 50 power is taken from both batteries and is seen as Active Usage.
<img src="images/image128.png" /></p>
<p>This means when we get to circuits that need more than 100 power, all
the batteries combined will show a max Active Usage. Active Usage is
used to calculate how fast a battery drains. If we are forcing batteries
to max drain then we might as well try to use as much as the combined
power the batteries will provide.</p>
<p>It is never good practice to mix and match different size batteries.
A large battery will last 4 hours, a medium battery will last 3 hours
and small batteries will last 15 minutes. If you mix and match, you can
only rely on maximum power for the amount of time the smallest battery
will last. For example, 2 large batteries and 1 medium for a total of
250rW. For only 3 hours will you get 250, the last hour will only
provide 200. There are situations where mixing is useful, but not for
the main battery backup on a centralized circuit.</p>
<p>Centralized circuits are simple, easy to work with and scalable. On
paper, you can make a centralized circuit very large and consume a lot
of power. The reality is to produce a lot and store a lot of power, you
will need a lot of land to build it on. In this next example, on paper,
we have 9 turbines on the 10th floor with 9 backup batteries feeding 36
auto turrets divided by 9 per North, South, East and West sides. It also
has 3 HBHF Sensors per side, Search Lights on each side and a bunch of
lights. The circuit is only an example and is not using its full power
potential. It could include a grid of tesla coils, destruction
detection, a camera network, automatic doors, TC/Vending Machine and
storage monitoring, an indoor garden, a system that makes your base look
online when you are offline and much more. The point here is size, very
large.</p>
<p><img src="images/image58.png" /></p>
<p>It is not so easy to see, with a circuit this large, and the ability
to be much larger, how one would go abouts physically building this. It
would be possible to centralize the location of the battery backup and
distribution but the size of the base will probably call for multiple
wire extensions. Any component can be used to extend a wire. The idea is
to make that component as cheap as possible. Only consuming 1 power and
being the resource cheapest component is the Industrial Lights. They are
easy to integrate as base lighting giving them the perfect camouflage.
Decentralizing the locations of a centralized circuit is possible but
difficult especially on large bases. At a certain point, you may find it
easier to just decentralize the circuit itself along with the locations.
 </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="decentralized-circuits"><a href="#decentralized-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Decentralized Circuits</h2>
<p>Decentralizing circuits really comes down to how extreme you want to
take it. The idea behind decentralizing is adding security and
reliability by segmenting different systems and areas with their own
independent power supplies and backups. Keep in mind, the type of
battery backup you choose is up to you but for our examples, we will
stick with inlines because it takes up less room in the pictures.</p>
<p>The first example shows decentralizing by separating the different
end circuits with independent power supplies and battery backups. The
Auto Turrets get their own power supply and inline battery. Same for the
SAM sites, interior lights, exterior lights and HBHF grid, they all have
their own power supply and inline battery backup.</p>
<p><img src="images/image55.png" /></p>
<p>While decentralizing based on end circuits is an option, if the
battery powering that circuit gets destroyed, that entire circuit will
become disabled. Having all your auto turrets go offline during a raid
is never a good thing. A more secure option would be to decentralize by
location. To keep the idea simple for the next example, let’s breakup a
base into 5 sections, North, South, East, West and the roof. By giving
each group their own power supply and backup, it prevents the entire
base from going offline when raiders destroy both the power supply and
battery backup. Decentralizing the circuit makes it a lot easier to
decentralize the locations. Wire length is limited, so depending on the
size of the base, being able to put the power source, battery backup and
distribution in a location that minimizes the need to wire extensions is
very appealing. If the base is of a smaller size, putting the power
supply, battery backup and distribution on the North side that powers
the South side has the clear advantage that in the event raiders come
through the South side, when they hit the electrical room on the South
side, it only disables the North side of the base. It is recommended
that when needing to extend wires, if you can’t put the extension
component in a protected area, use an industrial light and integrate it
into your base lighting.</p>
<p><img src="images/image54.png" /></p>
<h2 id="hybrid-circuits"><a href="#hybrid-circuits"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Hybrid Circuits</h2>
<p>A hybrid circuit is one that both centralizes, for convenience, and
decentralizes, for security, different parts of the same circuit. While
it is more common to see hybridization between power sources and battery
backup, it can also be done with distribution. To help demonstrate this
concept, we have the following 3 examples. The first 2 are using Inline
Battery Backups. In each example, a Counter is used to both show the
available amount of power but also represents an end circuit like lights
or turrets.</p>
<p>This first example demonstrates decentralizing power by having each
power source charge its own battery, with a centralized Inline backup by
combining the batteries before powering a circuit. This is a less than
ideal way to set up your power production and battery backup. Keep in
mind that Root Combiners do not share the load between batteries. This
means that a circuit needing 100 power or more will force all the
batteries to have a max Active Usage of 100. Read the section <a
href="concepts.html#battery-active-usage-vs-actual-power-consumed">Battery
Active Usage vs Actual Power Consumed</a> for a more in depth
explanation.<br />
<img src="images/dectr-pwr-ctr-bkp.png" /><br />
This kind of configuration is convenient to achieve a lot of power on 1
line but because in this example we are using Inline batteries, this
becomes progressively more expensive to maintain as you need to be
producing a significant amount more power than you need to. This also
removes the ability to take advantage of game mechanics to minimize
Active Usage on the batteries which should be a primary focus when using
an Inline backup.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to power 18 Auto Turrets. That is 180rW plus the
cost of distribution so we are going to need 2 large batteries which
give us 200 power, just like in the picture above. With no load sharing
between the batteries, they both will have an Active Usage of 100. With
the battery’s 80% efficiency, we need to give each battery 125rW. That’s
a minimum of 250rW we need to produce all the time so the batteries do
not drain.</p>
<p>If you have already read Battery Active Usage vs Actual Power
Consumed, you will know it is possible to power 9 turrets from 1
battery. If we power the other 9 from the other battery, this allows
each battery to only have an Active Usage of 90. With the batteries 80%,
we only need a power supply of 114rW per battery for a total of 228rW to
not lose power.</p>
<p>The larger this is scaled up, it is easy to see how much wasted
power, time and materials there are. That is why it is seen as
unsustainable for use in situations that are continuously online,
however, if you have a circuit that spends most of its time offline and
there are long enough periods of time between activity to let the
batteries charge, then it becomes much more practical to just get a lot
of power on a single line.</p>
<p>In the next example we demonstrate centralizing power by combining it
before the Inline batteries, while decentralizing the battery backup by
letting each battery power its own circuit. This gives us the benefit of
convenience by combining all the power sources into a single line then
using Splitters to evenly divide that power between all batteries,</p>
<p><img src="images/ctr-pwr-dectr-bkp.png" /> or, like in the above
picture, use an Electrical Branch to give priority to 1 battery while
evenly dividing the remaining power between the other 2. This gives us
the ability to prioritize batteries and also take advantage of
minimizing Active Usage per battery depending on the circuit it is
powering. This leads to a lower material and labor cost and wastes less
power.</p>
<p>Decentralizing the batteries is almost always the better option when
creating a hybrid circuit. While the above examples have used Inline
battery backups, in our 3rd example, we use a bypass battery backup
known as the Nih Core. This battery backup is natively a centralized
system but here, we have decentralized the batteries by dedicating them
to specific systems. This is called the Decentralized Nih Core. <img
src="images/decentnihcore.png" /><br />
It gives us the benefit of powering our circuits the majority of the
time with the main power source while also providing security by
separating the battery backup.<br />
In the event that the core or a battery is taken out, not everything
goes offline.<br />
<!-- [ deadman switch link ]() --> There is also an optional Switch
included if the system ever needs to be turned off.<br />
The Switch is powered by a small battery limiting the amount of time the
system can be off for.<br />
This prevents a team mate from turning things off and forgetting to turn
it back on.</p>

<p>This is when you directly connect what generates power to your
circuits. If your power source is destroyed or stops producing power for
any reason, your circuits will go offline. This method is a great
solution for short term uses like getting some auto turrets asap for
your clan or getting some water pumps online early for a berry farm.
While this method is good for a short time to get an early game
advantage, it is not recommended to rely on this method for any length
of time. We can introduce batteries to our circuits to create backup
power more suited for long term use.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to wire</li>
<li>Minimal components</li>
<li>Early game advantage</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If power source is destroyed the components turn off</li>
<li>No backup power</li>
<li>Short term use only</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 3 main types of battery backups. Below we have the Inline,
OR/Blocker and Nih Core.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="inline"><a href="#inline" class="anchor-link">*</a>Inline</h2>
<p><img src="images/image26.png" /></p>
<p>This is called Inline because power must pass through the battery
before powering something. Inline is the easiest way to give yourself a
battery backup. This method is fast to make and wire. It is reliable
assuming you are producing enough power to keep the batteries charged
and it is an easy way to decentralize your circuits. When you connect
your power source directly to your battery, 100% of that power is used
for the sole purpose of charging your battery. When your battery is
fully charged, any power above what is needed to maintain your battery’s
charge is not being used, which we call wasted. For example, a large
battery with an Active Usage of 100, needs to be given 125 to prevent it
from draining. If you are giving your battery 150 so it charges, when it
is fully charged, there is 25 power that is not being used. When it
needs to be charged, that 25 power is better then 1 power because it
will charge faster. For 1 battery it doesn’t seem like a lot, but when
you get into 4 or more batteries, that is 100 power being wasted. When
the power source stops making enough electricity, the battery will
continue to supply power until they are depleted or destroyed. It is
recommended to let the battery charge to a minimum of 3000rWm before
letting it power anything.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to make with minimal electrical components</li>
<li>Perfect for decentralizing circuits</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient use of power at large scale</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="orblocker"><a href="#orblocker"
class="anchor-link">*</a>OR/Blocker</h2>
<p><img src="images/ORblocker.png" /></p>
<p>This method has been around for a long time and is often called
‘Infinite Power’. It is not infinite power, it is just a bypass battery
backup. It has been carried over from a previous version of electricity
when batteries could only charge or discharge, not both at the same
time. During this time batteries did not have an Active Usage and forced
out max power causing the need to invent the ‘Infinite Power Loop’,
which actually was something, but it was not this circuit.</p>
<p>This is an OR/Blocker battery backup. It is a ‘Bypass Battery Backup’
that powers your main circuit most of the time from the main power
source, bypassing the battery, while the excess power is used to charge
the battery. When not enough power is produced, it will automatically
switch on the battery keeping everything powered. The reason it is now
considered out of date is because it doesn’t take advantage of the
batteries ability to charge and discharge at the same time.</p>
<p>The way this method works is by sending power into the first
Electrical Branch and branching out enough power to meet your circuit’s
needs. That power is passed to an OR Switch which sends power to your
circuit. The extra electricity from the first Electrical Branch is sent
to another Electrical Branch. Power is branched out to block the Blocker
which prevents the battery from draining. The extra power is then used
to charge the battery. When there is not enough power to keep the
battery blocked, the battery sends power out to the OR Switch to keep
your circuits online. Based on the picture below, green wire showing
what has power, red showing no power and yellow showing wasted power.
<img src="images/orblockerstates.png" /> If the Windmill only produces
75 power, it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first
Electrical Branch or block the battery. The battery takes over powering
your circuit but the 75 power is still coming out of the first
Electrical Branch. The power is still there, it is just not being used,
it is wasted.</p>
<p>While considered out of date today for use as a primary battery
backup system, with some small modifications, it is useful as a
secondary battery backup which we talk about in its own section.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to understand</li>
<li>Simple to build</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using battery power</li>
<li>Ignores the battery update to allow charging and discharging at the
same time</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="secondary-battery-backup"><a href="#secondary-battery-backup"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Secondary Battery Backup</h2>
<p>A secondary battery backup is a way to provide power to a circuit
after the main backup system goes offline. It’s a backup of a backup so
the chance that it gets used on a typical day is near 0. Using the
picture below, we will break down how it works.</p>
<p><img src="images/image109.png" /> </p>
<p>We are using a Test Generator to represent a static power source
meaning power levels won’t go up or down like wind and solar. The power
will either be there or it will not so we install the battery pre
charged. It should never be used so we don’t plan on recharging it. The
static amount of power from your main circuit, which already has a
built-in battery backup already, makes this battery a secondary backup.
So because the incoming power does not fluctuate, it is either present
or it is not, when the power is no longer present, this battery takes
over. The only reason this battery is ever used is because the main
power sources are no longer supplying enough power and the main battery
backup has also failed. The chance this battery is needed should be 0 so
we dont bother building in recharging.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses only a few components so it’s easy to build and wire</li>
<li>Efficient for redundant backup power</li>
<li>Can be inserted into almost any circuit at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful when using a dynamic power source</li>
<li>Requires a pre charged battery</li>
<li>Added costs for redundancy  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="nih-core"><a href="#nih-core" class="anchor-link">*</a>Nih
Core</h2>
<p><img src="images/image87.png" /></p>
<p>The Nih Core is the modern version of and replacement for the
OR/Blocker. When using a battery to power your main circuit, like the
Inline battery backup, you lose 20% of the power it receives. Bypass
battery backups, like the Nih Core, are a way around this. Instead of
your main circuit being powered by the battery, it gets power directly
from the Wind Turbine while the battery gets charged with the excess.
The Nih Core will automatically switch over to battery backup when the
power source is not producing enough.</p>
<p>The Nih Core is meant to be used with 2 or more batteries but we only
have 1 in the picture because it’s all we need to demonstrate how it
functions. The simple explanation is when there is not enough power to
meet your circuit’s requirements, it redirects the insufficient amount
of power to the battery and activates it to take over powering the
circuit. The reason the Nih Core is meant for 2 or more batteries is
because when running off windmill power, we don’t care about the
battery’s Active Usage. We are bypassing the battery therefore removing
any restrictions or conditions caused by it. Check out the section
called ‘Battery Active Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed’ for an in depth
explanation.</p>
<p>Using the following picture, we can see where power exists and where
it doesn’t when the Nih Core is running off of Main Power vs Battery
Power. The green wires have power and the red wires do not.</p>
<p><img src="images/nih-core-paths.png" /></p>
<p>To understand how this works, we need to understand the Memory Cell
and the Splitter. The inputs on the side of the Memory Cell are
prioritized from top to bottom and the Splitter when it receives power,
it sends out power from left to right. This also applies to when
Splitters lose power, they stop sending power out from left to right.
The section ‘Circuit Delay and Power Flow’ helps explain in detail how
rustricity moves around a circuit.</p>
<p>Based on the picture above, if the windmill only produces 75 power,
it is not enough power to meet the demand of the first Electrical Branch
which is set to 100. That first Electrical Branch will still send that
75 power to the Memory Cell, but this means no power is going to the
second Electrical Branch therefore the Splitter loses power. When the
Splitter loses power, Output 1 first stops sending power to SET on the
Memory Cell. At that moment, power from Output 2 is still going to
RESET, so the Memory Cell flips outputs. RESET loses power followed by
Output 3 going to Block Passthrough on the Blocker. The battery takes
over powering your circuit and the 75 power that is still going through
the first Electrical Branch and Memory Cell is now sent to the battery
extending its life instead of being wasted. This will take a 4 hour
backup time and extend it.</p>
<p>Here is a look at a Nih Core with 4 batteries. Keep in mind Max Depth
when using large numbers of power sources and</p>
<p><img src="images/ctr-nih-core.png" /></p>
<p>batteries. 16 power sources and 16 batteries is the most you can
connect before hitting the Max Depth. Check out the section ‘Short
Circuit / Max Depth’ for an in depth explanation on that subject.</p>
<p>If you notice that power is flickering off/on when switching between
main power and battery power, it is because 1 of 2</p>
<p><img src="images/nih-core-flicker-fix.png" /></p>
<p>issues. If using only 1 battery, Solution 1, add a Root Combiner
between the battery and blocker to keep the battery active. If using
more than 1 battery,  Solution 2, add 1 or 2 components between the
Memory Cells <code>Power Out</code> and the OR Switch. This will give
the circuit a chance to provide battery power before the Memory Cell
flips outputs.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-power-bus"><a href="#what-is-a-power-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>What is a Power Bus?</h2>
<p><img src="images/image127.png" /></p>
<p>A power bus is a group of components with the sole purpose of
directing the flow of electricity to different circuits that perform
specific tasks such as auto turrets or lighting. This is a lot like the
breaker panel or fuse panel you have in your home for your electricity.
Each breaker or fuse is dedicated for a specific room or purpose, like
the fridge, furnace, bedrooms or garage. A power bus also helps
prioritize the order in which circuits receive power. In the event you
are producing less power then you need, you have built in control over
which circuit is last to go offline. We have 3 types of power buses,
fixed, dynamic and configurable.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fixed-bus-f-bus"><a href="#fixed-bus-f-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Fixed Bus (F-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image115.png" /></p>
<p>A fixed bus, known as an F-Bus, is when you dedicate a specific
amount of power per output. This type of power bus always consumes the
amount of power each output is set to even if nothing is attached to
Branch Out. This will affect Inline battery backups by forcing an Active
Usage and it will affect a bypass battery backup by always consuming
power, even when the components connected to Branch Out are offline. A
fixed bus is an easy way to build in priorities and a bit of security.
The first Electrical Branch has the highest priority because it’s the
first to get power and in the event that power levels start falling, it
will be the last branch to lose power. The security comes from knowing
that if 50% of the power supply disappears, only some branches will lose
power and not all.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dynamic-bus-d-bus"><a href="#dynamic-bus-d-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Dynamic Bus (D-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/image51.png" /></p>
<p>A dynamic bus, known as a D-Bus, is when we let the components evenly
distribute power between all connected outputs. The only control you
have over the amount of power available to each output is the amount of
power you put into it. This is primarily used when the component or
circuit attached to each output requires the same amount of power or
when each circuit uses less than the available power and you want to
avoid the forced Active Usage from an Electrical Branch. If an output
gets destroyed, the system will evenly redistribute power between the
remaining outputs. The drawback would be that if the incoming power
drops too low to support the connected outputs, everything will stop
working or at least those that require the full amount of power that was
previously present.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="configure-siphon-c-bus"><a href="#configure-siphon-c-bus"
class="anchor-link">*</a>Configure Siphon (C-Bus)</h2>
<p><img src="images/multi-c-bus.png" /></p>
<p>A configure siphon, known as a C-Bus, is a bypass distributor that is
only active when required. The idea here is that we only want to use
power when the C-Bus is active otherwise the power just passes through.
We can set an Electrical Branch in the siphon to a specific amount of
power to only be used when the siphon is active. There are multiple
versions of the C-Bus, and we will dive into each one, but to start, I
just want to explain the concept.</p>
<p>All of them are centered around the Memory Cell. The Memory Cell has
2 outputs, Output and Inverted Output. One output is called the Main
Line (aka the bypass) and the other output goes to the Circuit that we
want to power. The Main Line is the default path the electricity takes
when the siphon is not active. It will pass from a Memory Cell to an OR
Switch and out. The Circuit path is the route electricity will take when
the Memory Cell gets triggered. It gets sent to an Electrical Branch
that is configured to an amount of power the circuit needs while the
remainder gets sent off to the OR Switch and back onto the Main Line to
continue powering the circuits past it. While this is the general
concept, we can get a little more specific.</p>
<p>There are 2 categories of Configure Siphons. There is the Auto Reset
which will automatically turn itself on when an input is received and
off when the input signal is removed. The second is Manual which
requires you to manually turn it on and off. Within each of these
categories there are 2 types. There is the standard C-Bus which is to be
used in a circuit that uses a bypass battery backup like the Nih Core.
The second type is the Blocked C-Bus meant to be used in a circuit that
uses an Inline battery backup. The reason 1 has a Blocker is because of
the nature of components and a battery’s Active Usage. The Blocker has
the ability to hide Active Usage from a battery when it is actively
being blocked. Read more about that in the section titled Battery Active
Usage Vs Actual Power Consumed.</p>
<p>Now to get very specific. Starting with the Auto Reset siphons, these
by default will send power out the Inverted Output(left output). Power
will be passed to an OR Switch then out. In the Blocked version, power
gets passed to an Electrical Branch that is used to block a Blocker
before passing power to the OR Switch and out. ‘Out’ could be another
siphon, another type of power bus or whatever you would like. We are
using a HBHF Sensor as our input source but it doesnt have to be. All we
need is a constant source of power to keep the siphon active. When the
sensor outputs power, it will ‘SET’ the Memory Cell. This will force the
Memory Cell to flip outputs and send power through Output(right output).
From Output, power will be sent to an Electrical Branch configured to +2
over the amount of power your circuit will need. The leftover power will
pass through Power Out and merge back into the Main Line. The power
coming out of Branch Out will go to another Electrical Branch that will
be set to the amount of power the circuit actually needs. The reason for
+2 is because we need 1 for the second Electrical Branch itself and 1 to
be sent out Power Out to ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell. In the blocked
version, we are simply adding a Blocker before the first Electrical
Branch so we can hide the Active Usage caused by the Electrical Branches
from a battery. When the sensor stops sending power to ‘SET’, the power
going to ‘RESET’ will force the Memory Cell to flip outputs back to
Inverted Output and return power to the Main Line. In the blocked
version, because of the Electrical Branch on the Main Line, the Blocker
will get blocked again to hide the Active Usage.</p>
<p>The Manual siphons function in a very similar way only instead of
using ‘SET’ or ‘RESET’ on the Memory Cell, we are using ‘TOGGLE’.
Everytime ‘TOGGLE’ receives power, the Memory Cell will flip outputs. We
have used the Button in the pictured examples but it doesnt have to be.
When it comes to which output on the Memory Cell is the Main Line or the
Circuit line, it really doesnt matter because you have the ability to
manually control which output power is actively passing through.</p>
<p>In all the examples we have used Counters at each output. This is
only to show you how much power each C-Bus costs to not be active. <a
