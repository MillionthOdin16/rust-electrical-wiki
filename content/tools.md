These tools take no damage, have a stack size of 1, are default BPs and
can only be crafted.

To change the colour of a wire/hose in place, with Wire/Hose Tool in
hand, hold Reload `R` to select the colour then look at an IO connection
and press Reload `R`

Wire length is limited to 30 meters with 16 anchor points using the left
mouse button.

If you miss click and attach a hose/wire to the wall in the wrong spot,
look away and right click once. It will remove the last anchor point.
Hold the right mouse button down to clear the hose/wire.

To remove a hose/wire from a component, look at the connection point and
hold down the right mouse button.

When hoses or wires are placed on walls and the wall is destroyed, the
hoses and wires will remain in place.

Wire Tracing: If you left click a pre wired connection, only that
connection will have the wire animation. The animation will return to
the rest of the wires after you take a couple steps or look at another
IO connection.

When trying to keep straight to get better hose/wire placement accuracy,
wear Diving Fins.

To increase or decrease the range of the auto snap when getting close to
an IO connection, in the F1 console, change `client.lookatradius` from 0.2
to 0.05. This lets you place anchor points closer to IO connections.

If the server has it enabled, turn on Wire Slack by holding your Use
key, default is `E`. Hold Sprint, shift, to increase and Duck, ctrl, to
decrease. This will give your wires some slack rather than being
straight between 2 points.
